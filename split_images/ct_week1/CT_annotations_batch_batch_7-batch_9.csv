From struggling to survive in the Philippines to becoming a Broadway bigwig with multiple Tony awards (and a Grammy!) under his belt — sounds like an impossible dream? Here is his story: “I still remember how my mom would stack the coins my dad earned for the day and try to figure out how to meet our needs. I never blamed my parents for being unable to afford things, even if that meant having no money to pay for my education. I didn’t want to add to their burdens, so I applied for scholarships that took me through high school and college. After graduation, I worked six simultaneous jobs, built my parents a house, and struggled to pay the mortgage. “I went to the United States believing that we all have the opportunity to be someone. I took every job that came my way: as a marketer, waiter, babysitter, grocery bagger, personal assistant, nursing assistant. Then I discovered the theater. It was the only thing that kept me sane. I loved the idea of coming in, sitting with the lights out, and getting entertained. I also loved to voice out my opinion, which I did with a regular group of theatergoers and eventually on my blog. “Then, the Broadway folks started asking for my thoughts on everything. It was official — I’m not a nobody! As I met more people and got more involved, I decided to invest. I had a little money saved for it, but my business partner said: ‘You pick the show, I’ll write the check.’ Since then, we’ve done more than 30 shows! I have worked with big names in the theater and go to awards shows. “Who would have thought that someone like me would end up with several Tonys and a Grammy? I never imagined it, not as the youngest child of a jeepney driver and beautician who lived in the squatters of Iloilo, Philippines. “But this is all bigger than me. I’m here because I wanted to give my parents the life they deserved but never thought they could have. Poverty is not a death sentence and I am living proof of that! Dreaming is free; why settle for less?” #AAPIstrong #APAHM #AAPIHM"

He went missing on January 1, 2008 after attending a New Year’s Eve party at a cabin near Bridge Lake, BC. The cabin was owned by his new girlfriend’s ex husband. She had driven Derek to the party, but drove home alone and didn’t notify family. In 2010, RCMP declared Derek’s case a murder investigation saying they have evidence from the cabin that points to murder. Police say they think they know who killed Derek, but for some reason several witnesses have been reluctant to cooperate with investigators. Derek’s girlfriend has since died from a drug overdose/suicide in 2012. The family believes Derek was set up, and that it could have been a revenge killing. Derek testified in a court case 12 years ago. The cabin owner and the accused from the court case know each other. The cabin owner, Brad Macelhinney, moved to Mexico after but has since returned to BC. Macelhiney's ex-girlfriend Laura, said she was told to leave the party before Derek disappeared. Laura thinks Derek was taken away by RCMP and put into witness protection, but the RCMP's position is firm: Derek Kelly is deceased. Anyone with information regarding this matter is asked to come forward by contacting the RCMP North District Major Crime Unit at 250-649-3924, or their local police service. Those wishing to provide information and remain anonymous, can do so by contacting Crimestoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).

Ella está recuperándose con el apoyo de su familia, la policía y la comunidad hispana. Lea una versión de este artículo en español → https://trib.al/gyY44La:=:https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article259946375.html The priest entered the hospital room alone, to pray for healing. He also administered Lisa Sidenstick her last rites. By this time in February, the Kansas City police officer and mother of four had been in a medically induced coma at North Kansas City Hospital for nearly a month. She was in grave danger of dying from COVID-19 and hope of recovery was slipping away. For weeks, her father, Joe Arce, founder and publisher of the bilingual newspaper KC Hispanic News, had been preparing himself for the death of his eldest daughter. “We just didn’t know if she would go at any minute,” he said. Sidenstick’s long illness, at a time when much of the country has tried to move on from the pandemic, hit home for two particular communities in Kansas City. Both members of the KCPD and the Hispanic community on Kansas City’s West Side rallied around Sidenstick and her family during her illness. As a Hispanic person and a police officer, Sidenstick, 45, is a member of two high-risk groups for COVID at once. The virus has been the No. 1 killer of police officers for more than a year. Hispanic Americans, meanwhile, have been at higher risk for hospitalizations or death from COVID-19, in part because of social determinants of health: lack of access to health care and higher exposure in the jobs they do. But most of all, she was unvaccinated. She was hesitant to get the vaccine before, she said, because it was developed quickly. She plans to get it within the next few weeks. “I wish I would have had the vaccine so this didn’t happen,” Sidenstick said. “But at the time I was scared.” Sidenstick woke up from a medically-induced coma in February, a few weeks after the priest read her last rites. Her life no longer in the balance, family and friends expressed relief at her miraculous turn for the better. Full recovery, however, is far beyond the horizon. As she begins that journey, she relies on help from her family and supporters in the KCPD and on the West Side.

Minutes after the ABC 13 Houston News story aired, Cinnamon’s caretakers contacted us desperate for sanctuary because she was about to be sent to the sale barn. Cinnamon would’ve been slaughtered because of a cyst on an ovary that deems her undesirable and of no use to a breeding facility for show cows. Residents like Cinnamon are why we ask you to become members. When you BECOME A MEMBER you help us advocate for families that are conflicted about the animals they are raising in FFA/4H. Our Families Choosing Compassion program is where we focus our efforts on changing the hearts and minds of those in the system so that it will end with them. The FCC program brings families of children together who are heartbroken by the slaughter of their friends in the FFA/4H models. We are a safe haven for children and families that can’t remain desensitized to the “food” animal structure prevalent in our education systems. We aim to instill a deeper awareness and appreciation of farm animals as unique individuals worthy of our love and respect. They are welcome to come to Rowdy Girl Sanctuary and spend time with their friend as long as he or she lives. Families Choosing Compassion gives families the compassionate option to truly bond with their animals forever. Thank you, Deborah Wrigley, of ABC, for this story that leads us to Cinnamon. Thank you to the caretakers who reached out to us in hopes of saving this beautiful being. Cinnamon is a God-send – she is truly the epitome of an old soul, and her emotions are seen and felt.

We have taken in and rescued more animals than we ever thought possible, in fact we kept setting limits but then kept going over them because there was always “just one more special animal” that needed a home. I have loved every single animal that has come through our gates, and connected with each one in a different way. I have had favorites even though I tried not to. Arthur was one of those. Those of you familiar with us know Arthur’s story. He was being given away for free on Craigslist as a butcher pig. And the person that had him demanded he be picked up because she could not transport him, she claimed he had a limp. Come to find out he was almost completely disabled from a spinal injury that was never treated. He joined our family June 22, 2017 and he crossed the rainbow bridge October 1, 2020. His rescue was nothing short of miraculous, many many people came to help rescue him and get him to safety. He was an incredibly special pig, and touched so many peoples hearts. Two little girls halfway across the country fell in love with him and sent him all of their allowance money and a beautiful Christmas card and a picture. That family went vegan because of Arthur, not only that they now rescue pigs. Arthur changed so many lives. We tried lots of different things to help his mobility and discomfort, CBD oil being one of the most helpful. He actually got to the point where he was quite mobile. And he had four little piglets who absolutely adored him, they snuggled with him every single night, they would even lick the food off his face. Arthur changed their lives. Hr gave so many people hope. He showed the world that with love and kindness you can overcome anything. He reminded us all to take joy in the simple things like a quiet morning or a sunset. His spirit is still very strong here, and not a day goes by that I don’t think about him. He absolutely changed my life. Forever in our hearts Arthur🐷🧡 #friendsnotfood #thatssomepig #govegan #compassion #sanctuary"

Then I sat with Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: 'I prayed to Allah to help me find a righteous companion.' So tell me a Hadith that you heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), so that Allah might benefit me from it. He said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ""The first thing for which a person will be brought to account will be his Salah. If it is sound then he will have succeeded, be salvaged, but if it is not then he will have lost and be doomed."" - (One of the narrators) Hammam said: ""I do not know whether this was the words of Qatadah or part of the report."" - ""If anything is lacking from his obligatory prayers, He will say: 'Look and see whether My slave has any voluntary prayers to make up for what is deficient from his obligatory prayers.'

The Khao Manee is a natural breed of Thailand. They exist only in white with shimmering eye colors. Khao Manee means “Like white diamonds”. Indeed, the Thai people prized this breed for its gem-like eyes. As the most highly regarded feline at the royal court of Siam, the Khao Manee used to be present at traditional royal ceremonies. Thai people considered them the most auspicious cat in Thailand because they believed that they had healing powers. They have sweet dispositions, although they can be shy with strangers, having lived secluded lives for centuries.

Unfortunately that's what the severe weather outlook for this afternoon has done, kicked it up a notch. Nearly all of central South Dakota has been upgraded to a 3 of 5 ENHANCED (orange) risk for severe storms. If you live in the orange shaded counties and areas, pay attention. A SLIGHT (yellow) 2 of 5 risk is posted for northwest Dewey, much of western Ziebach and southern Brule and Tripp Counties. Tornado threat: (green and brown map) A 2% probability is posted for the counties in green. Potter County is in a 5% probability in at the bottom of the brown shading. The tornado chances are low, but the best places would be in the brown-shaded counties. Wind threat: There is a 30% probability of storms with damaging 65 mph winds in the RED shaded counties. Within the BLACK hatched areas are a 10% probability of 70 mph winds or greater. Hail threat: The hail threat is slightly narrower than the wind threat but the probabilities are similar. 30% probability of 1-inch hail in the RED shaded areas. In the BLACK hatched areas is a 10% probability for 2-inch or larger hail. The hatched areas represent ""significant severe wind/hail"" meaning more likely to possibly cause damage. Storm development is still likely toward late afternoon, say 4 pm-ish. We do see on radar a rather stout storm in southern Ziebach County moving northeast (no warning, will post separately.)"

batch_9,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/batch_9/356485-5003657346337829.png,"Finding Islam By Dr. Laurence Brown There is a certain fascination with conversion stories, and for good reason. Frequently they involve dramatic life-altering events, sufficient to shock the convert out of the materialistic world and into the spiritual. Most who pass through such moments of trial and panic experience an overwhelming feeling of helplessness, and turn to their Creator in prayer. In virtually every case I know, they forget the strained theological formulas they have been taught and instinctively pray directly to our Creator. For example, a lady once related her ‘Born Again Christian’ conversion story on a popular evangelical television show. This lady told how she had been the sole survivor of a terrible boat-wreck. During her days and nights alone in the harsh elements of the open ocean, she told how God spoke to her, guided her and protected her and how, seeking His favor, she prayed to God and to God Alone. In her long tale, she mentioned God over and over again, and never once mentioned Jesus Christ. However, the moment she was saved by a passing ship, she threw her arms open to the heavens and yelled, “Thank you, Jesus!” There is a lesson here. When in panic and stress, people instinctively pray directly to God, without intermediary or intercessor. That is the default setting of our spiritual consciousness. However, when relieved of their distress, people frequently return to their previously held theological formulas, no matter how strained or bizarre. All converts feel God saved them, and that the miracle of their salvation justifies their beliefs. But there is only One God, so it makes sense that there can only be one religion that is true in all aspects. Hence, only one group can be right and all others are, to one degree or another, wrong. For the latter group, their personal miracles serve to confirm them upon disbelief rather than upon truth. As Allah teaches in the Holy Qur’an, “Allah leaves astray whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him]” (TMQ — Translation of the Meaning of the Qur’an: 13:27) and “So those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him – He will admit them to mercy from Himself and bounty and guide them to Himself on a straight path.” (TMQ 4:175) As for those astray in disbelief, our Creator leaves them to stray upon whatever misdirected path they themselves choose. So who will become Muslim based upon my conversion story? Only one person: me. Muslims might appreciate my story, others might not. Either way, here it is: In 1990, I was in the last year of my ophthalmology residency at George Washington University hospital in Washington, DC. My second daughter was born October tenth. To my great dismay, she was a dusky, gunmetal blue from the chest to the toes. Her body was not getting enough blood, and the cause was found to be a coarctation of the aorta — a critical narrowing in the major artery from the heart. Needless to say, I was shattered. Being a doctor, I understood she needed emergency surgery, with a poor chance of long-term survival. A consultant pediatric cardio-thoracic surgeon was called from across town, and I left him in the neonatal intensive care unit to examine my daughter. With no companion but my fears, I went to the hospital prayer room and fell to my knees. A product of Christian-American heritage dating back to 1677, nonetheless this was the first time that I even partially recognized God. I say partially, for even then I prayed the prayer of a skeptic, “Oh, God, if you are there . . .” I promised that if God existed, and if He saved my daughter and then guided me to the religion most pleasing to Him, that I would follow. I returned to the neonatal ICU roughly fifteen minutes later, and was shocked when the consultant told me that my daughter would be fine. True to his assessment, within the next two days her condition resolved miraculously, without medicine or surgery. She grew to be a perfectly normal child and as of this date — July 2008 — is on the verge of her eighteenth birthday. Now, as I said before, I am a doctor. And although the consultant provided a medical explanation for my daughter’s miraculous recovery, I simply didn’t buy it. I remember him explaining about a patent ductus arteriosis, low oxygenation and spontaneous resolution. But I also remember thinking, “No,” my daughter’s salvation was not a medical miracle, but a divine one. Many who make promises to God in moments of panic find or invent excuses to escape their part of the bargain, once God relieves them of their distress. I could easily have assigned my daughter’s recovery to the doctor’s explanation rather than to a miracle from God. But faith had entered my heart, and it wouldn’t leave. We had cardiac ultrasounds taken before and after, showing the stricture one day and gone the next, and all I could think was that God had made good on His part of the deal, and I had to make good on mine. Even if there was a medical explanation, (truncated)"

The heavier the rain, the more the dynamic cooling which will change the rain to snow. Good news? We get needed moisture!"

batch_9,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/batch_9/356561-707889403840136.png,"""If it'll save one life..."" The first screenshot is from a video I posted of Lottie, a teenager who was sexually assaulted for years and was impregnated. Her daughter passed away, but she's sick of Pro-Choice people using girls like her as a weapon (rape makes up less the 1% of reasons for abortion). Nicole is adamant that women should make their own ""choices."" Notice she never answered my question about whether she supported a woman's choice to kill anyone or just her son/daughter. The second screenshot is from a video I posted about raising the age to purchase a rifle to 18. It won't stop mass shootings. It'll make you feel like you did something, but most mass shootings are done with handguns and some of these shooters take other people's guns. And firearms save anywhere from 500,000 to 3M lives a year, according to studies. So, firearms save more lives than they take. Besides, 2A is about having a deterrent for your tyrannical government. But I thought it was interesting Nicole tried to use that ""if it saves one life"" line for guns while being for deliberately killing children."

This month allows us to pay tribute to the generations of Asian and Pacific Islanders who have enriched America's history and are instrumental in its future success. Today we want to recognize Professor Cynthia Goh, who was a pioneer in promoting access to hospice and palliative care in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region. Professor Goh was passionate about helping the dying live out their days as comfortably and with as much dignity as possible. She served on the Asia Pacific Hospice Care Network (APHN) as the Advisory Committee Chair and provided leadership on projects to help build capacity for palliative care in low- and middle-income countries. Professor Goh helped ensure that everyone who needed palliative care received it. Like Professor Goh, Gilchrist is committed to advocating for the needs of our patients and families. Thank you, Professor Goh, for your unending compassion, leadership and advocacy for the people who need it most. *Cynthia Goh passed away earlier this year from pancreatic cancer.

Thomas' contributions to the entertainment industry are historic and deeply felt as he continues to make way for more Black voices, art, and vision in film. #blackhistorymonth ID: A slide that is half text and half photograph. At the top is a black and white photograph of an African American man (Wynn Thomas) speaking to a white man (Robert Deniro). Together they examine a set of architectural drafting that Thomas is holding up. The title below reads: “Wynn Thomas.” Text in white over dark teal reads: “Wynn Thomas is the first Black film production designer. After graduating from Boston University, he designed for the Negro Ensemble Company and the Public Theater before moving into production design. Thomas is known for his long collaboration with Spike Lee, and his credits include: 'Malcolm X,' 'Cinderella Man,' 'A Bronx Tale,' A Beautiful Mind,' 'She's Gotta Have It,' and 'Inside Man.’ According to Thomas: ""It is the responsibility of the production designer to take the writer's words and turn them into real images.”"""
