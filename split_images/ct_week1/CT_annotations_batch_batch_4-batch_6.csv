What’s more shocking? That he has so much power and influence over the economy and our pocketbooks, in general? Or that the chair of the Federal Reserve’s name is Jerome Powell and he’s not Black? It’s him not being Black, right? Did his parents lose a bet? Both Jerome and Powell are top tier Black names. Right up there with Marcus and Williams. Whatever. On to less important issues. If you haven’t heard, Jerome in the House, Without a Doubt and the Feds have been fighting for their mf life trying to control the raging inflation in the United States. Based on my life experiences, there seem to be three stages of grief, with each stage becoming more apparent and noticeable. It’s Anger, Denial and finally, Nigga. Jerome Jenkins Powell IV and the Federal Reserve are currently at ‘Nigga.’ The Federal Reserve recently raised interest rates by 75 bases points, or .75%. ‘.75%, that’s nothing,’ I uttered to myself, even though I probably had a F – in Econ 101. Well, it’s not nothing, unfortunately. This is the highest interest rate increase in 28 years. The Fed’s policies, guidance and decisions are the equivalent of Zeus sending bylaws to his Greek subjects; or Malcom X doing that hand gesture thingy, commanding his Nation of Islam brothers to fall back, as the white cop says, “That’s too much power for one man,” or whatever he said in the movie. When Jerome Lamont Powell Jr. raised interest rates this high, with more to come, he is essentially telling us the Feds are freaking the fuck out and are willing to do whatever they can to stop inflation, which includes risking a recession. In BET movie standards, we are at the part where the actions taken at the beginning of the movie are coming back to bite us in the ass. Consequences, that’s the word (And also the working title for our BET movie). The consequences of this country dumping trillions into the economy inflated the value of the dollar. Between gas prices, inflation and the stock market correcting itself because idiots, I mean people overvalued exercise bikes and streaming services, we are essentially, ummm, fucked.” ~ @tall_tyrion"

Celestine Chaney, Roberta Drury, Katherine Massey, Heyward Patterson, Aaron Salter, Pearl Young, Ruth Whitfield, Margus Morrison, Andre Mackneil, and Geraldine Talley were civil rights activists, community volunteers, parents, siblings, and friends. They were victims of a direct attack on a Black community — an attack that is emblematic of a rising wave of violence driven by white supremacists in the U.S. The alleged shooter sought to do more than kill. It was his intent to use this act of terrorism to promote the hateful ideology that drove his actions. In extensive writings shared publicly at the time of the attack, he stated clearly his fear that immigrants and Americans of color are being used to dilute white culture and political power. This “replacement theory” — once a fringe political view — has been more widely circulated in recent years as some Republican politicians and pundits have used their platforms to amplify this message, legitimizing its place in conservative political culture. As a result, a growing number of citizens and leaders now sanction elements of this theory. The rhetoric supporting it is increasingly violent, xenophobic, and antisemitic, fracturing the bonds that sustain our pluralistic society. America began with a claim that each individual was created equally and endowed by God with certain inalienable rights. We must embrace this claim with conviction. It is the reason our nation came to be. And because of this founding ideal, this country does not belong — and never has belonged — only to one race, one ethnicity, one religion, one culture. Those clinging to bigotry and white supremacy commit “blasphemy against the American creed.” As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we are committed to the doctrine that “all are alike unto God” and that “God is no respecter of persons.” An increasingly multiracial society is a welcome fulfillment of our national promise. People of diverse backgrounds living together in peace will be the hallmark of Zion. We echo President M. Russell Ballard’s call “to embrace God’s children compassionately and eliminate any prejudice, including racism, sexism, and nationalism.” White supremacy is a corrupting ideology. It is rooted in individual and cultural pride. It is driven by fear and seeks to spread fear that corrupts our nation, churches, schools, and homes. Because we know that “perfect love casteth out fear,” we cannot be passive in the face of this rising evil. We must each work boldly and actively to root out racism and create a just peace in our own hearts and in our communities. This is not easy or comfortable work; it will require courage, great love, and ongoing concrete action. As we welcome others with charity and seek unity in the midst of our differences, we lay the foundations of Zion. We encourage all to “renounce war and proclaim peace.” https://library.mormonwomenforethicalgovernment.org/official-statement-buffalo-shooting-replacement-theory-white-supremacy/ What concrete actions can you take or are you taking to root out racism?

We are always doing, going, rushing or talking. Cell phones are our constant connection with life outside of ourselves. We are not used to quiet or time for our own thinking, Yet, stillness is part of the awareness of the presence of the Sacred which we call prayer. It involves no commotion or agitation. Rather, to be still is to seek a serenity, a calm, a tranquility of being. We exchange our usual business, noise and activity for silence and quiet. We are free. We become aware. In experiencing stillness we can touch into our inner selves and open ourselves to the Holy Mystery within and around us. . Prayer I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands Psalm 63 Action Review the times for stillness in your day. Where can you make this happen realistically? Suggested Readings At the mountain of God, Horeb, Elijah came to a cave where he took shelter. Then the Lord said to him, “Go outside and stand on the mountain before the Lord; the Lord will be passing by.” A strong and heavy wind was rending the mountains and crushing rocks before the Lord— but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake— but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake there was fire— but the Lord was not in the fire. After the fire there was a tiny whispering sound. When he heard this, Elijah hid his face in his cloak and went and stood at the entrance of the cave. 1 Kings 19:9a Be still and know that I am God Psalm 46:10 Only in silence does man succeed in hearing…the voice of God, which really makes him free. Pope John Paul II In the business of this day Grant me a stillness of seeing, O God. In the conflicting voices of my heart Grant me a calmness of hearing, Let…my words and my actions Be rooted in a silent certainty of your presence. Let my passions for life… Be grounded in the experience of your stillness. J.Philip Newell Within you, there is a stillness and a sanctuary to which you can retreat at any time and be yourself. Hermann Hesse Sometimes you need to sit lonely on the floor in a quiet room in order to hear your own voice and not let it drown in the noise of others. Charlotte Eriksson In the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you. Deepak Chopra My heart is tuned to the quietness that the stillness of nature inspires. Inayat Khan Learning how to be still, to really be still and let life happen – that stillness becomes a radiance. Morgan Freeman"

Like … ➡️ Leah Jeffries was cast as a lead in the new Disney+ show adapting the popular YA series “Percy Jackson and the Olympians.” Jeffries is Black and in the book it’s implied that the character is white. And angry fans made their feelings known by getting the 12-year-old star’s TikTok banned. ➡️ The BBC announced that “Sex Education” star Ncuti Gatwa will take on the title of the Doctor in the next season of “Doctor Who.” He'll be the first Black man to play the lead. Now, some are criticizing the series for what they say is a “woke” casting decision. So, why are diverse casting decisions so controversial, especially with fictional shows?

This guy stands for everything conservatives say they don't like but secretly jerk off to when the lights are out and the doors are closed. Putin has been in charge of Russia as president and prime minister for 23 years. Putin is notorious for cronyism and corruption. Putin is known for repression of domestic opponents and free speech. He is the architect of military aggression and chaotic disruption abroad. Putin has legitimized and normalized assassination as a tool of state policy. Putin has run Russia's economy into the ground and now thanks to renewed sanctions it's going to get a lot worse. Businesses flee Russia because they cannot rely on the Rule of Law there to protect their business dealings or prevent attempts at extortion and bribery. Russian forces in Syria have murdered civilians and helped destroy the country.
