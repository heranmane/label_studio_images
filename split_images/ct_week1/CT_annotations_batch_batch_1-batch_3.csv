Along with Sylvia Rivera, she established the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) in 1970, a group committed to supporting transgender youth experiencing homelessness in New York City. Marsha P. Johnson was tragically murdered on July 6, 1992 at the age of forty-six. Her case was originally closed by the NYPD as an alleged suicide, but transgender activist Mariah Lopez fought for it to be reopened for investigation in 2012. Today, Marsha P. Johnson is now one of the most venerated icons in LGBTQ+ history, has been celebrated in a series of books, documentaries, and films.

A HUGE thank you to everybody who has helped make this possible—especially Representative Brandon Potter (District 16) and Farm Sanctuary board member (and fellow Rhode Island resident), Rob Procaccianti, who have championed this important effort since the beginning. Foie gras survivors like Matisse are some of the sickest animals we care for. He arrived at our Watkins Glen Sanctuary dirty, terrified, and ill. During his initial health exam, he stood on the scale and flapped his wings—likely for the first time ever. Although his feathers were broken and his wings were in rough shape, he seemed so proud. We're expecting major industry opposition, so it will be imperative for Rhode Island residents to get active in urging state senators to support this humane legislation. Stay tuned for ways to take action, and help spread the word to everyone you know in Rhode Island who cares about protecting animals like Matisse from intolerable abuse.”"

In the 13th Century, a person could travel from the edge of Poland all the way to Korea and might never leave Mongol territory. Yet all empires inevitably over-reach and then decline. That moment came for the Mongols in 1260 at the Battle of Ayn Jalut (in modern-day Palestine) The Mongols began their conquest of the Middle East in 1258 when Baghdad, the cultural epicentre and capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, fell in an orgy of violence. Conservative estimates of the sacking of the city put the death toll at 200,000. Along with slaughtering the inhabitants, the invaders also destroyed Baghdad’s mosques and libraries, including the storied House of Wisdom. Eyewitnesses said that when the pillaging was over, the Tigris River ran black from the ink of books that were dumped into the water. By erasing centuries of learning, the Mongols were clearly trying to destroy all elements of Muslim rule in the Middle East. On September 3rd, 1260, the two sides numbering 20,000 men each met in battle in Ain Jalut. The Mongols were the first to strike. The Mamluks had a clear advantage because they knew the terrain very well, and Qutuz used that fully to his advantage. The strategy was actually laid out by Baibars because he had spent the most time in the region. Qutuz hid most of his forces in the highlands, and Baibars fought the Mongols with hit and run tactics in an attempt to bait them out. The fighting dragged out for hours with neither side gaining the advantage until Baibars finally feinted and pretended to withdraw from the battle. The angered Mongol commander, however, made the fatal mistake of not suspecting the trick and heedlessly chased the retreating army. When the action finally reached the highland, Qutuz’s army surrounded the Mongols, and the Mongols were suddenly trapped in the tight vice of the Mamluk armies."

Excess proteins can’t be stored in the body so the body will convert excess proteins to glucose which will trigger a release of insulin. This process is called gluconeogenesis. It is a demand driven process and I see it occur very frequently in my clients with Reactive Hypoglycemia because they are sugar burners (and lack metabolic flexibility), thus the demand for glucose is often higher. Additionally, protein causes a mild an insulin response so without the fat, this affect is more pronounced. Add carbs to the mix and you’re looking at a significant blood sugar and big insulin spike (which may come with an inevitable crash for my RH friends) This is why the recommendations on a keto diet are for fatty, not lean protein. When we eat proteins that come with fat, this helps to slow the absorption of the glucose and blunt blood sugar spikes, thereby reducing the chance of a blood sugar crash. Fats have virtually no effect on blood sugar & insulin and keep you satiated and energized for hours. Fats are like logs on the fire- they burn low and slow 🪵🔥 Carbs are like the kindling, burning hot and fast. PS- Many people can do fine with some lean protein but if you have blood sugar crashes or RH, you may want to experiment with fattier proteins and observe the effect in your blood sugar. Again, this is not saying no one should ever have the foods on the right, but if you’re struggling w crashes or blood sugar issues, experiment with the foods on the left! 👉 If you haven’t seen my Reactive Hypoglycemia Masterclass you can catch the replay here: https://www.daniellehamiltonhealth.com/offers/8vXLnBA5/checkout 🤍 In this class we dive into the causes and symptoms of RH and look at why the traditional recommendations not only keep you stuck on the blood sugar roller coaster, but actually make you worse! 🎢 And most importantly, I give you loads of strategies and tips to start improving your blood sugar & stopping the crashes 🥳 #reactivehypoglycemia #bloodsugarcrash"

When Mike joined TanTara in 2012, he was fresh out of driving school and eager to start his career as a professional driver. After finishing his training, Mike hit the road in the flatbed division. Throughout the next 7 years, Mike would accumulate a lot of experience and achievements. Having become a flatbed driver trainer himself, in 2016 Mike was selected to compete in the Iowa Truck Driving Championships. Mike had also been chosen as a “TanTara TopGun”, a group of elite drivers who served as leaders and mentors to TanTara’s driver corps. In 2019 Mike parked the truck and moved into the office where he currently serves as Driver Liaison. Today, Mike conducts driver training classes, vehicle safety inspections, & ensures that our drivers are set up for success by arming them with any training, tools, equipment, or information they may need. Mike is passionate about the work we do here at TanTara, and he is always looking for ways he can help improve our company and make this a better place to work.

They later met and married in the U.S. Lyly shared that having been fortunate enough to be born in the U.S., she didn’t truly know or understand the immigration process before joining USCIS as an adjudications officer. Seeing the different journeys people have taken to achieve the American dream, and being part of the process, has made her truly appreciate what parents go through to through to provide better opportunities for their children or relatives. Lyly added, “this is especially true now as USCIS is paroling Ukrainian and Afghan nationals. Like my parents, circumstances beyond their control have forced them to leave their home country. I took for granted the many opportunities and advantages I was afforded from being a natural-born citizen and working at USCIS has not only humbled me but provided me with an opportunity to give back.” We thank Lyly for all she does to support our immigration system and process."

The first time I met Lindsey, it was at a protest of the Chicago carriage industry. She was so exuberant, telling me that she loved my writing, so of course I loved her on the spot. For less self-serving reasons, though, I was immediately and forever taken with her unabashed activism, her confidence and warmth, not to mention her deeply-held belief in herself. She even got pushed by a carriage driver that day and laughed it off before telling him off. She was so freaking relentless. I stood with Lindsey and exchanged laughs and tired, cold smiles with her behind our scarves at so many other cold season protests. Countless times... I remember another time, we were protesting an inane ""running with the bulls"" thing and some bro twit threw a hamburger at her. You'd better believe she went after that POS. I remember day after day, she would be protesting the circus when they were in town on behalf of CompassionWorks International. Standing out in the cold, organizing everything, never, ever phoning it in, except to say that she actually had the BRILLIANT idea to record herself to play it in her megaphone when people were walking past so she didn't have to be talking the whole time. When families decided to not go, she would embrace them, flash that megawatt smile, shower them with gratitude. The last year the circus came to town, we knew it was the last year but they had their remaining contracts to fulfill. That last performance, Lindsey packed it up and, if I recall correctly, flipped off the United Center while crying tears of joy. ""You're gone!"" It was over for Ringling Brothers and we were celebrating. We get so few occasions like that. We lost a good one. The world lost a true gem. Lindsey was: Beautiful, confident, hilarious, tender, tough, passionate, so very talented and, most of all, a truly dedicated, compassionate soul. I'm looking out the window as I write this and seeing a beautiful lilac sunset. Maybe this is you, Lindsey. Until -- if? -- we meet again. The world is a hard place for those of us who feel deeply. Hold the ones you love close to your heart and let them know how much you care. Lindsey Pearlman, you were a priceless jewel, a bad-ass beyond description and you will be missed. The National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 800-273-8255."

Frida came to us in November 2020 from the shelter after we found out that she was on the “Code Red” list meaning imminent Euthanasia if she did not exit within days. Thankfully a foster stepped up which ultimately saved her life and is the reason she’s alive today! Frida was a senior who arrived at the shelter as a stray. She had a large tumor on her abdomen as well as a smaller one on the temple of her head. Thankfully they were able to be surgically removed and later found out they were benign. She ever so patiently waited for a forever family for many months but then…It was like love at first sight - Seriously! Her new mama knew instantly that it was meant to be and was filled with tears of joy the moment their eyes met. Frida is now settling in beautifully into her new home and is helping her mama heal her heart after the recent loss of her last senior dog. We love those who adopt the seniors, they truly have a special place in our hearts. Happy Tails, Frida!! Here’s to MANY new memories with your new family! We want to give a HUGE thank you to Paula for stepping up to foster Frida and so that we could bust her out of the shelter! #fosteringsaveslives"

But few know the surprising history behind this chilling practice. For starters, no historian has ever found any evidence of water torture originating in China. Instead, most experts point to a 15th-century Italian lawyer named Hippolytus de Marsiliis as the man who first documented the technique. He recorded the method after he observed that continuous drips of water slowly eroded pieces of rock and decided that the same practice could likely be applied to humans. But even though water torture has been around for hundreds of years — and has been used on countless prisoners — the term itself didn't appear in writing until 1892, long after it was first described.

batch_3,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/batch_3/355704-4978996298827560.png,"Saint Josephine Bakhita Feast: February 8 Bakhita was born around 1869—she herself did not know the precise date—in Darfur in Sudan. At the age of nine, she was kidnapped by slave-traders, beaten till she bled, and sold five times in the slave-markets of Sudan. Eventually she found herself working as a slave for the mother and the wife of a general, and there she was flogged every day till she bled; as a result of this she bore 144 scars throughout her life. Finally, in 1882, she was bought by an Italian merchant for the Italian consul Callisto Legnani, who returned to Italy as the Mahdists advanced. On 9 January 1890, she was baptized and confirmed and received her first Holy Communion from the hands of the Patriarch of Venice. Upon her baptism into the Catholic Church, Bakhita took the name Josephine. On 8 December 1896, in Verona, she took her vows in the Congregation of the Canossian Sisters and from that time onwards, besides her work in the sacristy and in the porter's lodge at the convent, she made several journeys round Italy in order to promote the missions: the liberation that she had received through her encounter with the God of Jesus Christ, she felt she had to extend, it had to be handed on to others, to the greatest possible number of people. The hope born in her which had “redeemed” her she could not keep to herself; this hope had to reach many, to reach everybody. Known for her sanctity and common sense wisdom during her 50 years as a religious sister, Saint Josephine Bakhita died in 1947. The example of a saint of our time can to some degree help us understand what it means to have a real encounter with God for the first time. Josephine Bakhita’s journey to sainthood was a remarkable one. She was canonized by Pope Saint John Paul II in the Great Jubilee Year 2000. At Bakhita’s canonization, Saint John Paul II called the first saint from Sudan “a shining advocate of genuine emancipation” for women victimized in today’s world. “The history of her life inspires not passive acceptance, but the firm resolve to work effectively to free girls and women from oppression and violence and to return them to their dignity in the full exercise of their rights,” the pope said. Some have promoted Bakhita as a possible patron saint for the victims of human trafficking, the modern-day form of slavery that includes forced labor and many women and children of both sexes being forced into prostitution. The feast day of Saint Josephine Bakhita, February 8, has been designated by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as a day of prayer to raise awareness of, and to help end, the scourge of human trafficking. Throughout his first year as pontiff, Pope Francis has decried the evil of human trafficking, showing great concern in both his Easter and his Christmas messages to the world. He called human trafficking “a crime against humanity,” saying that we “must not allow these women, men and children to be treated as objects, to be deceived, raped, often sold and resold for various purposes, and in the end either killed or left devastated in mind and body, only to be finally thrown away or abandoned. It is shameful.” In the face of this daunting evil, Bakhita does indeed offer a shining example of true freedom. In his 2007 encyclical on Christian hope, Pope Benedict XVI highlighted her, noting that as a slave she endured daily floggings that caused her to bleed – she bore 144 scars from her suffering – but she found hope in the living God who knew her and loved her (Spe Salvi, 3-5). Later, as a woman religious, Bakhita shared her faith and the liberation she received from Jesus. Such an encounter with the Lord of all lords, who suffered and died on the cross and rose to new life, was “an encounter with a hope stronger than the sufferings of slavery, a hope which therefore transformed life and the world from within,” Pope Benedict wrote (Spe Salvi, 4). As Saint Josephine Bakhita shows us, that hope can lead humanity to true freedom. St. Josephine Bakhita, you were sold into slavery as a child and endured untold hardship and suffering. Once liberated from your physical enslavement, you found true redemption in your encounter with Christ and his Church. O, St. Bakhita, assist all those who are trapped in a state of slavery. Intercede with God on their behalf so that they will be released from their chains of captivity. Those whom man enslaves, let God set free. Provide comfort to survivors of slavery and let them look to you as an example of hope and faith. Help all survivors find healing from their wounds. We ask for your prayers and intercessions for those enslaved among us. Amen. Prayer O God, who led Saint Josephine Bakhita from abject slavery to the dignity of being your daughter and a bride of Christ, grant, we pray, that by her example we may show constant love for the Lord Jesus crucified, remaining steadfast in charity and prompt to show compassion. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who (truncated)"

In a recent interview, lead star Anthony Anderson shared that while he and his on-screen wife #TraceeEllisRoss are close friends now, things weren’t always so amicable between the two. Anderson revealed, ” I knew Tracee prior to “Black-ish”… We laugh about this now, but Tracee didn’t like me for maybe 10 years!” The 51-year-old comedian said that the two initially met when they hosted the Vibe Awards in 2005 and he didn’t make the best first impression. “As we were walking onto the stage, there was a loud sound over the speaker, and I said, “Tracee? Did you fart?” The audience loved it, but what I did not know is how offended Tracee was by that comment.” The two reunited in 2011 when Anthony Anderson appeared on Ross’s sitcom “Reed Between the Lines”. Although majority of the scenes were done together, Anthony remembered she would leave the stage when he filmed his close-up shots and would say, “The stage is Anthony’s!” He admits that he initially thought Tracee Ellis Ross was doing it to be kind, but later learned she really did it because she didn’t want to be near him due to their previous interaction years ago.

Our sweet elder goat Blanca really needs a better living space (she lives in the tack room right now), this space would be perfect, also would be great for future rescues & storage and 2. Because I have to put a deposit down on this structure by tomorrow. And then I woke up to a very upsetting message- saying that followers are talking about us and are actively choosing to not support us because we pull at their heart strings too much. I literally can’t even tell you all how much a statement like that effects me. The fact that some people around the world want to pull support from us because we take on horrific rescue cases breaks my heart. That we save animals from going to slaughter? That we fundraise for animal intakes because that is how we can continue to do the work that we do?? I know I shouldn’t let messages like that bother me, I know that 99.9% of the followers we have love us and want us to continue to save more lives, but I am just like everybody else, I have just devoted my life to the care and protection of farm animals - so yes, messages like that effect me. If you are able and want to donate towards this new infrastructure cost, that would be amazing. If not, I absolutely understand. I am so incredibly grateful for everyone’s love and support, I am grateful for everyone who is kind to us, that doesn’t trash talk about us, thank you. Thank you.

The high level of care the survivors have is a testament to the dedication of Michelle and Mark over the last decade, and is something that I am committed to continue.” Maria will ensure that the survivors who call PEAK their home will continue to live their best lives and can shine their light to the world.

RIVER-CHANSUM is a sweet little thing (maybe 25-30lbs) and she has come a long way with trust since being pulled from the dog slaughterhouse. She now seeks us out for play, and loves playing with all the other dogs. She walks on a leash ok (while being very vigilant) but is still SUPER timid about the big world outside. Walks are not really her thing yet, but she’s learning… River has NEVER been in a house or home. She has never sat on a sofa, or Experienced a quiet afternoon listening to the birds with a trusted friend. River is right on the precipice of learning to be loved and to settle in to joy a little bit. She’s not quite there yet, but suddenly she is forgetting to be scared here and there, and we even saw some tail wags and playful pounces. River will need a patient person/family/home that will work to earn her trust and help her to find confidence in the world! She is just now learning to accept petting and love. More about River Timid. Good with Dogs, Good with Older/Considerate Kids Only, Good with Adults, Quiet, Cratetrained, Playful, Timid, Eager To Please, Gentle. Please contact Colleen colleen@startrescue.org if you have the capacity to help her to find her place in the world. She’s a true gem 💎 #portlanddog #portlanddogs #pdxdogs #pdxdog #pdxpets #pnwdog #pnwdogs #pnwdoglovers #pnwdogsofinstagram"
