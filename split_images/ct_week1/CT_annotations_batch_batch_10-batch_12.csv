Born in Brooklyn, she became involved in local Democratic party politics in the 1950s, leading to her election as state legislator despite facing discrimination for being female. A decade later, she made history through an upset election victory to become the first Black woman to sit in Congress. As a Congresswoman, she supported expansions of social services, fought for indigenous land rights, and helped found the Congressional Black Caucus among other achievements. She also opposed the Vietnam War and fiercely advocated for the Equal Rights Amendment. In 1972, she became the first African American to run for a major party‚Äôs nomination for President and the first woman to appear in a presidential debate. While her campaign was unsuccessful, she blazed a trail for future generations. In 1983, Chisholm retired from Congress to return to her original dreams of teaching, serving as a Professor at Mount Holyoke College and speaking at universities around the nation. In 1993, she was inducted into the National Women‚Äôs Hall of Fame and, in 2015, was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Education to explain Beefmaster benefits was the first step. In 2020, farmers and Dept of Livestock Development imported over 100 live animals and 10,000 units of semen. Top genomic seedstock are now in demand with export and cargo value exceeding $1 million for livestock and $250,000 for frozen genetics (semen and embryos) since 2009. 2020 exports were up to $920,450.00 and year to date 2021 reported sales from 5 producers total over $1.7 million and growing.‚Äù Adaptability to Thailand and the heartiness of the Beefmaster Breed have been key to making these export opportunities a reality.

That is better for you, if you know."" ~Holy Quran 62:9 Hon. Elijah Muhammad, teaches on pg. 138 of Message to the Blackman in America of the Daily Congregational Prayer and its purpose: In a civilized spiritual society, while private prayer ‚Äúis meant simply for the development of the inner self of man, the public part has other ends as well in view: ends, that, indeed, make the Islamic prayer a mighty force in the unification of the human race.‚Äù The Honorable Elijah Muhammad writes, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ this gathering of all people living in the same vicinity five times daily in the Mosque, is a help to the establishment of healthy social relations. In the daily service these relations are limited to a narrow circle, i.e., to members of the same neighborhood. But the circle becomes wider in the weekly Friday service which gathers together all Muslim members of a particular locality and becomes still wider, in the two great ""Id"" gatherings. ‚ÄúThus, prayer promotes social relations between the different sections of the Muslim community. Far more important than this, however, is the leveling of social differences brought about by means of congregational prayer. Once within the doors of the Mosque, every Muslim feels himself in an atmosphere of equality and love. ‚Äú Tune in via webcast tomorrow at noi.org/jumuah:=:https://www.noi.org/jumuah/ Friday @ 1pm CST! #NOIFridays #Jumuah"

""We'll be aggressive in our pursuit of anyone who subscribes to the ideals professed by other White supremacists and how there's a feeding frenzy on social media platforms where hate festers more hate,"" New York Gov.

That criticism often stems from misconceptions. Some people believe that gentle parenting means never disciplining your children, never using a stern tone, or always letting kids get their way. This week on the podcast, we are joined by parenting coach, and author of the upcoming book Very Intentional Parenting @destini.ann to discuss what gentle parenting really does (and doesn‚Äôt) look like. See an excerpt from the podcast blog post below ‚§µÔ∏è Destini likes to say that she puts her foot down‚Äîshe just does it gently. Empowered parenting involves firm but gentle boundaries. It also includes acceptance and understanding when your children have big feelings in response to those boundaries. She pointed out that people often think empowered parents aren‚Äôt holding boundaries. But the very fact that children are displaying big feelings is evidence that they are. If gentle parents always gave in, their children would be happy all the time‚Äìnot openly expressing frustration, disappointment, or anger. But sometimes observers perceive that expression as disrespect. As she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost as if they want us to punish our kids when they don‚Äôt like our discipline.‚Äù Sometimes adults expect more from their children than they do from adults. They demand that children control their emotions, but they yell at them. They give demands to children, ordering them to ‚Äúask nicely.‚Äù We often ask too much of children but don‚Äôt model desired behaviours for them.

There are some people who worship Allah as if they are on a ledge. One foot in Islam and one foot out. As long as things appear to be going well for them, they are content and will claim Islam as their religion, Allah as their lord and Muhammad as their messenger. But soon as a trial, tribulation, calamity, adversity or misfortune strikes, they put both feet on the other side; ten toes down on a path leading to their own destruction. Learn how to be spiritually sturdy and solid. Tests don‚Äôt come to destroy you, they come to expose the real you.

He then approached a 57-year-old Asian woman and punched her once in the face; police said the two did not interact at all before the attack.

The suspect moved to Gramercy Park for his next attack, where he approached a 21-year-old Asian woman and punched her in the face ‚Äî once again, no words were exchanged between the attacker and victim. Five minutes later, near Irving Place and East 17th Street, the man attacked a 25-year-old Asian woman without warning. The next two attacks took place in lower Manhattan, police said. The attacks happened as the Asian-American community in New York City continues to express fear and frustration over recent unprovoked assaults. From Jan. 1 through Feb. 23, which doesn‚Äôt include Sunday‚Äôs attacks, police said there were at least seven anti-Asian hate crime attacks in the city compared to three in the same time period last year.

We had lobster mac, shrimp and grits, clam chowder poutine, ‚ÄúChinese Takeaway‚Äú, and that‚Äôs Shay‚Äòs fried oyster sandwich with all the beautiful red sauce on it. I can tell you right now that the clam chowder poutine was fantastic, and the star dish of the night! Go get it, Asheville, I know you love poutine! The shrimp and grits was also a stand out, and brought back good memories for me of Chef Cox‚Äôs grit cake from the Montford Pull-up. The lobster mac and the Chinese Takeaway were also delicious, make no mistake about that! And Shay seemed to enjoy her oyster sandwich! If you haven‚Äôt been to Mother Ocean Market to eat their hot food, or to buy their seafood from out of the refrigerated case, or freezer case, or to check out their pantry of herbs, spices, and sauces, you best get on that soon!

In partnership with UW-Green Bay, the summits focus on 6th grade students of diverse backgrounds, including Somali, African American, Latino/Latina, Asian American/Pacific Islander and First Nations. Today, our 6th grade Latino students had the opportunity to participate in workshops and tour the campus during their summit. Big thanks to JBS Beef - Green Bay, WI for donating funds to purchase shirts for students and staff with flags that represent where our students are from. The purpose of the Achievement Summits is to provide a positive opportunity for students to see themselves in the world of postsecondary education and learn how to navigate the challenges they may encounter. In addition, the summits focus on creating positive cultural identity, which can improve student success resulting in increased graduation rates and postsecondary enrollment. #GBAPSProud #CollegeReady"
batch_12,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/batch_12/354403-10159138041638600.png,"Newly released tax filings revealed how Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors used charity funds to pay her friends and family large sums for various 'consulting' services, as well as charter a private flight. The documents reveal that BLM paid a company owned by Damon Turner, the father of Cullors' child, nearly $970,000 to help 'produce live events' and provide other 'creative services.' The co-founder's brother, Paul Cullors, received more than $840,000 for providing security services to the foundation. Leaders have attempted to justify the expense by saying the foundation's protection could not be entrusted to former police professionals who typically run security firms because the BLM movement is known for vehemently protesting law enforcement organizations. A consulting firm run by Shalomyah Bowers, who is BLM's board secretary and has previously served as deputy executive director, was paid more than $2.1 million for providing the organization with operational support, including staffing, fundraising and other key services. The new filing also revealed that Cullors reimbursed BLM $73,523 for a charter flight for foundation-related travel, which the organization says she took in 2021 out of concern for COVID-19 and security threats.
