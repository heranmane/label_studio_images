But sadly rooster rescues bring in the fewest donations of any animals in our care and they are some of the most expensive animals to house especially former cockfighting roosters like Blueberry who will likely never be able to be integrated with other roos. Today is #TwoDollarTuesday and we have so far to go to reach our goal to build a special space for Blueberry where he can heal and begin to overcome some of the terrible traumas he has endured. We still have so many ongoing expenses and rebuilding projects from the flood that we truly cannot build Blueberry the space he needs and deserves without your support. Please consider giving just $2 today. We have over 8000 followers here and if each of you gave $2 we would not only meet but exceed our goal!! And everyone who gives any amount towards this fundraiser will receive this Roosters Rule sticker featuring Blueberry as a thank you! Just email your mailing address to animals@littlehillsanctuary.org Venmo: @ littlehillsanctuary PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/littlehillsanctuary Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/littlehillsanctuary Read Blueberry's story and consider becoming his sponsor here: https://littlehillsanctuary.org/blueberry/ Go Fund Me for Emergency Flood Relief: https://www.gofundme.com/f/69wqaa-emergency-flood-relief?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1:=:https://www.gofundme.com/f/69wqaa-emergency-flood-relief And always the most impactful way to support the animals is to become a monthly donor: https://littlehillsanctuary.org/donate/

Here are some suggestions for showing support, care, and advocacy for your Muslim colleagues 🌟🌙 Also want to make sure it’s clear that I’m sharing these suggestions from my own point of view and the advocacy I would have appreciated in my past workplace where I was the only Muslim staff member. I’m fortunate now to work at a school with many Muslim colleagues, and already an identified space to pray. I also work with folks who are much more informed because of our community population and the programming in the school district. I think the reason that the question, “Not Even Water?” feels triggering is that it has come from a place of judgment rather than curiosity. So I’m not telling folks not to be curious but rather think about your intention behind a question and identify ways to be informed instead of putting that burden on BIPOC.” #ramadan2022 #ramadan"

In multiple areas, our services to our community expanded, and we found ourselves in the fortunate position to do more good. SCSCR's Adoption Program accepted 433 cats and kittens into our care, only short of beating our 2020 record by six cats! 174 of those cats were transfers from other shelters, the most transfers we have ever accepted in a 12-month period. Additionally, 39 senior cats were given permanent sanctuary at our facility in 2021 (though a handful of those found their own forever homes), another record! SCSCR's Spay/neuter Program fixed 468 cats - that is the most in program history! Of those surgeries performed, 42% were performed on pets owned by community members, breaking another record in program history. This would not be possible without the amazing dedication of Dr. Kathy (M4 Ranch Home Veterinary Service). Her tireless efforts (along with Sharon and Jules) impact this community in such a strong way! SCSCR's Sanctuary Program housed 12 cats in 2021 - that's another program record! This program houses kitties at no cost to their owners while they are going through difficult situations, such as homelessness, chemotherapy, military deployment, substance abuse treatment, escaping domestic violence, and more. Thanks to our supporters like you, whether you have adopted, volunteered, donated, utilized our program services, or all of the above, 2021 was a record year for SCSCR, and with your help moving forward, 2022 can be even better!"

This year, the Walk For Freedom will bring together thousands of people from hundreds of cities worldwide in the fight against human trafficking. When you host a Walk For Freedom in your community, you could help… ✖ a neighbor recognize the indicators of trafficking and report it. ✖ a mother proactively speak with her kids about online exploitation and how to avoid it. ✖ a concerned teacher implement practices to detect vulnerability and trafficking tactics. Awareness begins with people like us — refusing to turn our heads to this injustice and wait for someone else to do the work. Instead, we hit the streets, call our friends, and use our influence to raise educate those around us. You can apply to be a Walk Host at A21.org/WalkHost:=:https://www.a21.org/content/walk-for-freedom-2021-dayof-walk/gsnbgg?permcode=gsnbgg and join us as we walk this October.

It is so much more than this, but the intention is to elevate those of us former Latinx children who grew up in fear of adults & of being ourselves, along with amplifying the stories of children who have been victims of violence & abuse, all kinds. It may sound like it’s only in reference to corporal punishment, pero la 🩴 is an emblem of the power that adults feel they have over kids. It is Adult Supremacy in Latinx families, it is the celebration of stereotypes of violent adults which may feel bonding to us at first before we recognize that there are parts of us that were hurt & oppressed by it. So, in honor of Child Abuse Prevention month, we are bringing attention to #𝐄𝐍𝐃𝐂𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐂𝐋𝐀𝐂𝐔𝐋𝐓𝐔𝐑𝐄 𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐓𝐇, which seeks to illuminate the right for the children in our lineages to live free from harm, violence, & abuse. Children whose stories matter, whose stories need telling, whose bodies, minds & spirits need protecting in the face of colonial systems of violence & oppression. We are here to advocate for their sacredness. We are here to advocate for OUR sacredness, which was often not upheld in our upbringings. We are here for the inner children of our family members, our ancestors, of our future ancestors & descendants. We are here. We are beyond wanting to survive. We deserve to thrive. And we must begin w/the liberation of children in our communities. We will be shortly announcing a very special offering, along with other ways of connecting w/one another in this shared vision by way of the relationships we hold with our children. I invite you to subscribe to our mailing list, SHARE this post in your stories, or add us to your favorites here so that you can keep updated. Keep open your inner ear, your inner eye, & keep your 🫀 open to your own story. Sidenote: I just finished the first edits on the proposal for a book being written for parents in our comunidad on this topic. I can’t wait to share more but for now, please do celebrate with me the completion of this task along w/the birthing of #EndChanclaCulture month! Stay tuned, gente hermosa."

But has anyone been paying attention to Cartoon Network recently?! I mean damn! They don't even hide it, they talk about political issues like it's a daily topic for kids. I don't normally watch cable TV, but I recently went on a weekend trip to the beach and I turned on cartoon network. And the commercials between shows were no different than these Tweet samples. Using specific terminology with their young audience such as activism, diversity, inclusion. In fact, I chose to watch the Disney Channel instead of cartoon network cuz it was LESS politically obvious on their channel. -Pemmin-"

Note 1: However this should not be considered binding. Note 2: If one hasn’t cut his nails or removed body hair for up to forty days, and by practicing on the above, he will be exceeding the forty day limit, he should not delay. In this case, he is instructed to rather remove the hair/nails etc. instead of waiting till after slaughter. This is because Shari’ah instructs us to remove unwanted hair/nails once every forty days. (Refer: Badhlul Majhud, under Hadith: 2791)"
