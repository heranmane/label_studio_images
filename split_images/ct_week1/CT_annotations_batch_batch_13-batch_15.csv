Shavuot, the Jewish Pentecost, is a holiday that today commemorates the single most important event in Israel’s history: the giving of the Torah to Moses at Mount Sinai. 📜 Although it is not as well-known among non-Jews as Passover or Sukkot, the Feast of Booths, it is one of the three major festivals often called “pilgrim” festivals because in Bible times, all Jewish males were required to observe them at the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. Christians will be more familiar with the Greek name for Shavuot, Pentecost — the holiday that Jesus’ followers were observing in Jerusalem when the Holy Spirit was given to them. Since Pentecost is the Greek word for 50, and as Shavuot occurs 50 days after the first day of Passover, it was referred to as Pentecost in the Christian Bible. The holiday is also known as the “Feast of Weeks,” since it is celebrated seven weeks (or 50 days) after Passover. Learn more about this Jewish holy day by taking this quiz from our friends at The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews: https://bit.ly/3m5OnYQ:=:https://www.ifcj.org/learn/quizzes/shavuot-quiz-2"

To trace my Family Tree is saddening because I can’t go much farther. Due to choices made by Men, who existed in another time. It’s not your fault for what took place, and it’s definitely not mine. So here I sit Brown Skin and Black, thinking of our history. And the craziness Satan creates the lies the hate and bigotry. I was born in America 50 years ago, yet my description always varies. Before you get bent out of shape, just hear me out seriously. We went from: Negro Colored Afro American African American and Blacks So many names over these past years, how can anyone keep track? The point I’m trying to make today is it’s a brand-new season. Will we ever stop labeling each other without rhyme or reason? How about we call each other, By the name of our born country. Or maybe we just say hello, I’m Stephen have you met me? Some of you may get upset because I say I’m Brown, While others get it 100% without expecting me to expound. One day we will all learn a fact, and get the bigger picture, Our skin is our body's protection, not how we judge a character. So yes we have been doing it wrong, for many, many years. Crossing streets and hiding purses, because of ignorance and fears. So hopefully my words helped one or maybe even three. To step closer to that glorious dream, of being united and free. To bond with our fellow man, regardless of our looks. To take a stand for justice and create new history books. Because once we wake up to life and really truly see. That this Brown Skin Black man, Is an American human being. No matter what my background, or the color of my skin. Just take the time to know me, because there are treasures within. And I will do the same to you, we have to make a start, To stop judging by our skin, and start looking at our hearts.

Between August 7, 1950, to July 20, 1953, enemy forces captured 221 Marines. Of those, 12% died in captivity (in contrast, 38% of all American POWs died while interned). Almost every POW faced threats of death, reduced rations, lack of medical care, solitary confinement, and physical beatings or torture if he failed to respond to questions. Some were even told that injury would be inflicted on their families by the Communist underground in the U.S. if they did not cooperate. In February 1957, Army psychiatrist Major William F. Meyer stated, ""The Marines were a statistically significant group from the standpoint of size, something over two hundred; the only thing I can say about them is that more of them survived than we. I think this is a function of discipline and morale and esprit; and the attitude in the Marine Corps I expressed a little while ago, that if something happens to me, these jokers will take care of me."" #marinehistory #usmc #SemperFi #militaryhistory #americanhistory #Veterans #Military #podcast #koreanwar"

In the United States, obesity is definitely an issue, however black men are not the problem! Stop deflecting and take some accountability, ladies. Obesity Percent by race/sex (highest to lowest): #1 Black Women (55%) #2 Hispanic Women (51%) #3 Hispanic Men (43%) #4 White Men (38%) #5 White Women (38%) #6 BLACK MEN (37%) #7 Asian Women (15%) #8 Asian Men (10%) *African Americans have high incident rates of obesity. As a matter of fact black women have the highest rates of obesity in America. 55% (54.8%) percent of Black women are obese. This number had been steadily on the increase despite the effort to bring awareness to healthy living. Unfortunately, Black culture contributes to the increase. Partly due to the Black diet which consists of many fried and fatty foods.

Martinez, 46, is the alleged boss of La Eme’s Southern California wing, which makes him the organization’s No. 1 shot caller. He’s been locked up since the 1990s and last week was indicted for drug possession for personal use. Late last year, Martinez had one of two cases he was facing thrown out of court on appeal due to perjured testimony. The case he is currently appealing is his conviction for the March 31, 1994 stabbing death of Ricky Michaels in the midst of a gang brawl in the parking lot of an apartment complex when they were both 18. The pair were parts of rival Mexican Mafia cliques representing Fullerton and Placentia, respectively. There were five Placentia gangbangers charged in Michaels’ murder and Martinez was not accused of being the assailant who actually plunged the knife into Michaels’ chest and physically killed him.

She was forced to return Blush as her daughter had left for college and her job had grown more time-intensive, now requiring travel. She felt it was unfair for Blush to be left alone so long, and she was right. So, Blush came back to Texas, where everyone was thrilled to see her again. 😊 She just needed the right forever home.

The teachings of the Buddha affirm not only that slavery is morally wrong, but also that freedom from the oppressions of caste, race, and poverty is a powerful foundation for the liberation of the heart. Emancipation is an ongoing process as long as hatred and violence born of racism persist in our communities. These ancient harms gain in strength during times of collective stress and uncertainty, and we are troubled to see how hatred is still invoked daily by some of the most powerful voices in the world. May racism and all forms of racial bias be uprooted through wise action in our communities, tireless dedication to the path of interdependence, and fearless inquiry into the roots of ignorance in our own hearts. Blessings and a joyful Juneteenth to all."

We are always honored to share the history of Edenton and Chowan County, and we especially love connecting locals and visitors with resources to explore their family history here in this area. This past June, one such searcher came through our door at the Barker House, and we are so thrilled that she shared her journey with us! This individual was Tara Roberts, a full-blown National Geographic Explorer, and a Chowan County native! She was in the process of developing a podcast to document the work of a team of Black scuba divers searching for the wrecks of slave ships that made the Middle Passage, and wanted to delve into her own region's history as part of the process. She came to the Barker House to learn about Harriet Jacobs, and ended up extending her stay in the area since there was just so much Edenton history that she wanted to explore! Over the next couple of days she shared the history of the Roberts family with us, and how her ancestor John ""Jack"" Roberts was born into slavery and later enlisted as a USCT soldier as one of his first acts as a freedman. His descendants, many of which served with honor in the military as well, later acquired one of the historic homes in Chowan County. We are so thankful that Tara decided to spend some time with us, and that she pushed back her flight so she could attend the first Juneteenth event in Edenton, and end her visit with such a meaningful milestone. We are thrilled to announce that the trailer for Tara's podcast, ""Into the Depths"", was released today, and that her work will feature as the main article in the March edition of the ""National Geographic"" magazine!

B. Cooper. ✈😎🪂💥📍 (Sorry to step on your toes, FBI – Federal Bureau of Investigation!) The BLM mapping sciences division recently surveyed the land near Oregon’s Wild and Scenic Sandy River. They then compared the landscape against the flight path of Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, the plane once commandeered by Cooper. After determining where Cooper may have landed after parachuting from his hijacked plane, our teams sent Merle Wildman, BLM Recreation Specialist, into the field. Wildman hoped to find some evidence of the infamous felon. What he didn’t expect to find was the man himself—who had been dispersed camping on BLM public lands for 51 years. On November 24, 1971, Cooper boarded a Northwest Orient flight flying from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington. He hijacked the plane, extorted $200,000, and demanded to be flown to Reno, Nevada. Midway through the flight, he parachuted out of the plane. Until our mapping team’s latest discovery, nothing was known of his fate. During his time living in the Oregon wilderness, Cooper has become an avid land steward. “Have you heard of Leave No Trace?” asked Cooper. “I believe in responsible recreation. It’s up to all of us to care for these beautiful lands.” After jumping from Flight 305 and landing near Sandy River, Cooper decided to stay. “It was the most beautiful place I’d ever seen,” he said. “Even with all my stolen money, why would I choose to go anywhere else?” Now at 82 years of age, Cooper has spent his time fishing in the Sandy River, hiking the foothills of the Cascades, and learning about the amazing botanical diversity in this forested gorge. Our teams thanked Cooper for his diligent care of public lands these past 51 years and reminded him that dispersed camping is allowed on public land for a period not to exceed 14 days within a 28 consecutive day period. This places him slightly over the allowed time. After locating Cooper, our mapping teams began work on their newest project: the D.B. Cooper National Scenic Area. This map is free to the public and features directions to family fun along Oregon’s Sandy River. You’ll find hiking, mountain biking, rafting, slacklining, base jumping, and, yes, skydiving.

batch_15,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/batch_15/354690-5090921497659444.png,"There is no “one” real person inside of them that is fully functioning or normal, instead there are many made up facsimiles of people they use to cover up their dark reality to gain access into the lives of normal and healthy people. SO, it follows that there is no proper internal mechanism that exists or functions as it relates to a Narcissist having a normal and functioning ‘personality’ that can relate in a healthy manner with the outside world and the people in it. The reality that exists (and I am very loosely using that word reality) is a thin veneer or skin that is like a mask and costume they CREATE and wear that corresponds with their needs at any given moment TO TRAP ANOTHER TARGET/VICTIM. It is very interchangeable at any given moment as well, so it fools the rest of the world and protects the Narcissist from being EXPOSED as the abusive person that they are. From my Book: Greg Zaffuto - Author - From Charm to Harm and Everything Else in Between with a Narcissist https://www.amazon.com/Charm-Harm-Everything-Narcissist-Narcissistic/dp/1523820179/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1468750462&sr=1-1&keywords=from+charm+to+harm:=:https://www.amazon.com/dp/1523820179/ref=tsm_1_fb_lk They are like a chameleon that is able to change the color of its skin to match its environment and they are amazingly adept at this. The Narcissist disengages, detaches, or un-knows their dark inner self and easily identifies with something external and creates (or wears) this projected ‘good’ image instead – and there you have it a different person for every different ‘need’. That need is usually to trick their targets and use them as ‘Narcissistic Supply’ and just a major component of their survival (again they need us for SUPPLY.) Basically their functioning image is the biggest lie that this extortionist uses in their arsenal of deceit or ABUSE. Or as my friend said ‘compartmentalization’ – they compartmentalize us to fit the many different and exacting needs they have for each of us. Now that is pretty messed up! The relationship with yourself, or the one that requires a conscience, morals, empathy, a soul, etc., is a pretty important relationship to be lacking COMPLETELY, and pretty much a requirement or prerequisite to being a functioning human being and living life NORMALLY with others. If you don't relate to your own self or your life in a healthy matter, how can you relate to anyone else in a ‘healthy manner?’ JUST MY POINT – a Narcissist lacks the mechanisms needed to be a ‘fully functioning human being’ so they invent what they need as they go along in life and we play along or join in unknowingly with their toxic and destructive game. It is how they survive because they NEED US to be able to survive and live amongst us daily because for now we are still the majority here on this planet. BASICALLY we are here to supply them OR fulfill their every need, be it financially as in a career, sexually to fulfill their physical needs, familial so ‘they’ have a proper ‘face’ to appear ‘normal, moral and ethical’, friends to help them shore up their façade and believe their ‘lies’, or whatever they can harvest and use from people to fill in the huge VOID that they are. None of us serve anything more OR are more than a “bit part” in the Narcissist deranged and disordered life. We function to serve a specified need the Narcissist has at a specific time, AND they may have multiple relationships going on at once to secure all the supply they can get – but we are none the wiser!
