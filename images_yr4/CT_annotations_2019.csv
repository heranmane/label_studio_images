For great is his steadfast | love toward us,* and the faithfulness of the LORD endures for- | ever. Ascribe to the LORD the glory | due his name;* bring an offering, and come in- | to his courts! Old Testament Reading Isaiah 60:1–6 1Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you. 2For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you. 3And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising. 4Lift up your eyes all around, and see; they all gather together, they come to you; your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried on the hip. 5Then you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and exult, because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you. 6A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD. Epistle Ephesians 3:1–12 1For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles— 2assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you, 3how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. 4When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, 5which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. 6This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 7Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. 8To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 9and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things, 10so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. 11This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, 12in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him. Holy Gospel Matthew 2:1–12 1Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, 2saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.” 3When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; 4and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. 5They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet: 6“‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’” 7Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. 8And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.” 9After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. 10When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. 11And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. 12And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way. Alleluia and Verse Matthew 2:2b Alleluia. Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him. Alleluia. Collect of the Day O God, by the leading of a star You made known Your only-begotten Son to the Gentiles. Lead us, who know You by faith, to enjoy in heaven the fullness of Your divine presence; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever."

2019,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/images_yr4/2019/10156951206929281.png,"There are many teachings and practices in our tribal cultures that are significant to who we are as Native people. One of many things important to our cultural identity is, our hair. Our hair is considered sacred and significant to who we are as an individual, family, and community. In many tribes, it is believed that a person’s long hair represents a strong cultural identity. This strong cultural identity promotes self-esteem, self-respect, a sense of belonging, and a healthy sense of pride. As part of the practice in self-respect, we are taught to take good care of our hair through proper grooming. In preparation for ceremonies, we take great care in the grooming, styling, and ornamentation of our hair. Our hairstyle and ornamentation are guided by the values of our family and tribe. It is a form of creative self-expression that reinforces our connection to our family, tribe, and Creation. Some tribes will use two braids, while others will use three. Some families will paint their hair depending on the ceremony or their family’s distinction. Women and men will adorn their hair with fur wraps, woolen wraps, feathers, fluffs, and bead work for war dancing and ceremonies. How we relate to our hair is a constant reminder of our connection to our culture and a distinct worldview grounded in the sacredness of relationships. Braiding a child’s hair is the beginning of establishing an intimate and nurturing relationship. My mother used to braid my little brother’s hair every day before school. When my grandfather died, my mother cut my brother’s hair. She expressed the sadness she felt because she could no longer sit with him and braid his hair. It was a special time of bonding for the two of them. At pow-wows, it is common to see family members and friends brushing and braiding hair for each other. It’s a beautiful way to bond and a powerful way to reinforce the sacredness of relationships. There is a teaching about the symbolism of the braid, itself, that reaffirms this practice. It is said that single strands of hair are weak when tugged on, however, when you pull all of the hair together in a braid the hair is strong. This reinforces the value of the family and tribe along with our connection to all of creation. When I was about 5 years old, my grandfather first told me about being forced to cut his hair when he was carted off to boarding school, and I am sure I heard this more than a dozen times as I grew up. But as I got older, he would tell me more about his experience and what it meant to him. Eventually, he told me his hair was cut in an effort to strip him of his culture and identity. Cutting his hair was their way of showing dominance over him through forced assimilation. He said that every time his hair was cut, he would cry, and every time he would cry, he would be physically punished. Unfortunately, being forced to cut our hair was a common practice in many institutions and schools across the country, and is still occurring as recent as 2018. His story is important because we are taught as children that we don’t cut our hair unless we have experienced a significant loss, like the death of a close family member, traumatic event or significant life change. Tribes have different teachings about the value of hair and how to care for it. In our family, we are taught that our hair is a physical extension of all our thoughts, prayers, dreams, aspirations, experiences and history. When we cut our hair, it represents the end of something that once was and a new beginning. When we do have to cut our hair, it is never to be thrown away, but rather, burned with sage or sweetgrass in a ceremonial way. When our hair is burned, all of our thoughts, prayers, dreams, aspirations, experiences, and history rise to the Creator to be properly taken care of. We are then guided in the direction for our prayers to be answered. Throwing our hair away is a form of personal disrespect. So, when my Grandfather had his hair cut off and thrown away, his tears were of deep grief, confusion, helplessness, and shame. It was against everything he had ever been taught, along with grieving the loss of everything his hair represented to him. When this cultural practice was common in most Native communities, it was easy to recognize when someone in the community was grieving or experiencing a significant change in their life, because their long hair was no longer. With our hair embodying so much of who we are, boundaries are important. Touching someone’s hair without permission is disrespectful in the Native community. Some even find that asking permission is a form of disrespect, especially with children and elders. This is not something to take personal, it’s our way of protecting ourselves from the energy of someone we know nothing about. Does your family or tribe have special teachings about hair? We would love to hear and learn from you. Written by: Barbie Stensgar Colville Tribe - Arrow Lakes Band Photo Credit: (truncated)"

The act required African Americans migrating to Ohio to prove they were free, required a $500 bond to guarantee good behavior and fined employers who dared to hire those who weren’t free. Measures followed that barred black residents from serving on juries and testifying against white defendants. Historian Leon F. Litwack wrote that no extensive effort was made to enforce the $500 bond requirement until 1829, when the rapid increase of the black population alarmed white officials in Cincinnati, who declared that African-American residents had to obey the Black Codes or leave within 30 days. After black residents appealed for more time, a white mob cut the time short, burning African-American neighborhoods and beating the residents. About half of the city’s black residents fled to Canada. Other states, including Indiana, Illinois and the Michigan Territory, followed with their own Black Codes."

The Congressional Oath of Office is a legally binding oath which includes the clause of protecting our nation from threats foreign and domestic. To IGNORE a substantiated, imminent threat to our nation is an undeniable breach of the oath... And, to risk our national security just so you can stack democrat-controlled areas with as many illegal aliens as possible prior to the 2020 Census goes beyond criminal to the point of traitorous.... For those that haven't heard it yet, here's Democratic Strategy for Congressional Control: The Democratic Party NEEDS as many illegal aliens in their democrat-controlled areas as possible prior to the 2020 US Census if they want to maintain their seats in the US Congress and if they have to Sacrifice thousands of Americans to achieve this goal, so be it!!! After the US Census(performed once every 10 years), the 435 seats in the US House of Representatives are divided up by state populations and the last one resulted in one seat for roughly every 770,000 people... Soooooooo, let's say California has about 4 MILLION non-citizens living there right now... That means that FIVE of their seats in the US Congress are due to people who are not Americans being counted in the Census!!! NOW, imagine if by 2020, when they do the next census, they had 10 MILLION non-citizens living in California.. That would mean California would get 10 SEATS in the US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES due to non-citizens... NOW, do you see why Democrats want Open Borders??? The Democrats found a way to get money and seats in Congress without even having to rig elections!!!"

THE REAL REASON DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS OPPOSE BORDER SECURITY Editorial by Kevin Ryan President Trump told the nation tonight why he wants $5 billion in funding for border barriers. Democrats are already criticizing his rationale, using talking points they’ve pushed over the past month, to explain their opposition. WALLS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE: Senator Schumer recently said that not a single Democrat “will support bilking the American taxpayer for an ineffective, unnecessary, and exorbitantly expensive wall.” The comment is beyond ironic coming from the leader of a party that supports hugely expanding the $4.4 trillion annual federal spending, much of which bilks the American taxpayer for ineffective, unnecessary, and exorbitantly expensive government programs. The $5 billion in border security that President Trump is asking for amounts to just 0.11% of the total budget. WALLS ARE IMMORAL: “A wall, in my view, is an immorality. It’s the least effective way to protect the border and the most costly. I can’t think of any reason why anyone would think it’s a good idea — unless this has something to do with something else,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said earlier this month. If walls are immoral, how do Democrats explain the billions they’ve spent to build barriers at the border in the past? If they’re immoral, should we tears down the hundreds of miles of fencing currently in place? WALLS ARE INEFFECTIVE: This is perhaps the most intellectually dishonest of all the reasons to oppose a border barrier. Walls are used to keep people out everywhere, from the big walled off estates that many of our politicians live in, to other countries’ borders. In Hungary, an electrified, barbed wire fence reduced illegal immigration by 99.7%. Israel erected a security fence after a rash of terror attacks by people illegally entering the country. The attacks all but ceased. Walls do work. Instead, the real reason Democrats suddenly oppose barriers is the same reason politicians oppose (or support) anything: politics. A year ago in January, Schumer offered to give Trump $25 billion for a wall in return for a pathway to citizenship for the 1.8 million DACA “dreamers”. According to PBS NewsHour, Schumer’s offer faced “scalding criticism from his party’s liberal activist base,” and he rescinded it just a few days later. Fast forward to last month. Schumer offered $1.6 billion in border security funding as part of the government spending bill. It triggered a wave of backlash from progressive Democrats, once again forcing Schumer to backpedal, writing that the money will not be allocated to a concrete wall. Trump critics then went even further, saying that “Trump could claim any funding, including to repair damaged border fencing, as a victory for the wall and the GOP.” Ever since then, Democratic politicians have insisted on zero funding for a wall, fence, or even border security. Strong border security, once a bipartisan issue, has become politicized.

For great is his steadfast | love toward us,* and the faithfulness of the LORD endures for- | ever. Ascribe to the LORD the glory | due his name;* bring an offering, and come in- | to his courts! Old Testament Reading Isaiah 60:1–6 1Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you. 2For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you. 3And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising. 4Lift up your eyes all around, and see; they all gather together, they come to you; your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried on the hip. 5Then you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and exult, because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you. 6A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD. Epistle Ephesians 3:1–12 1For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles— 2assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you, 3how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. 4When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, 5which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. 6This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 7Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. 8To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 9and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things, 10so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. 11This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, 12in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him. Holy Gospel Matthew 2:1–12 1Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, 2saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.” 3When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; 4and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. 5They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet: 6“‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’” 7Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. 8And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.” 9After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. 10When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. 11And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. 12And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way. Alleluia and Verse Matthew 2:2b Alleluia. Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him. Alleluia. Collect of the Day O God, by the leading of a star You made known Your only-begotten Son to the Gentiles. Lead us, who know You by faith, to enjoy in heaven the fullness of Your divine presence; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever."

2019,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/images_yr4/2019/10156951206929281.png,"There are many teachings and practices in our tribal cultures that are significant to who we are as Native people. One of many things important to our cultural identity is, our hair. Our hair is considered sacred and significant to who we are as an individual, family, and community. In many tribes, it is believed that a person’s long hair represents a strong cultural identity. This strong cultural identity promotes self-esteem, self-respect, a sense of belonging, and a healthy sense of pride. As part of the practice in self-respect, we are taught to take good care of our hair through proper grooming. In preparation for ceremonies, we take great care in the grooming, styling, and ornamentation of our hair. Our hairstyle and ornamentation are guided by the values of our family and tribe. It is a form of creative self-expression that reinforces our connection to our family, tribe, and Creation. Some tribes will use two braids, while others will use three. Some families will paint their hair depending on the ceremony or their family’s distinction. Women and men will adorn their hair with fur wraps, woolen wraps, feathers, fluffs, and bead work for war dancing and ceremonies. How we relate to our hair is a constant reminder of our connection to our culture and a distinct worldview grounded in the sacredness of relationships. Braiding a child’s hair is the beginning of establishing an intimate and nurturing relationship. My mother used to braid my little brother’s hair every day before school. When my grandfather died, my mother cut my brother’s hair. She expressed the sadness she felt because she could no longer sit with him and braid his hair. It was a special time of bonding for the two of them. At pow-wows, it is common to see family members and friends brushing and braiding hair for each other. It’s a beautiful way to bond and a powerful way to reinforce the sacredness of relationships. There is a teaching about the symbolism of the braid, itself, that reaffirms this practice. It is said that single strands of hair are weak when tugged on, however, when you pull all of the hair together in a braid the hair is strong. This reinforces the value of the family and tribe along with our connection to all of creation. When I was about 5 years old, my grandfather first told me about being forced to cut his hair when he was carted off to boarding school, and I am sure I heard this more than a dozen times as I grew up. But as I got older, he would tell me more about his experience and what it meant to him. Eventually, he told me his hair was cut in an effort to strip him of his culture and identity. Cutting his hair was their way of showing dominance over him through forced assimilation. He said that every time his hair was cut, he would cry, and every time he would cry, he would be physically punished. Unfortunately, being forced to cut our hair was a common practice in many institutions and schools across the country, and is still occurring as recent as 2018. His story is important because we are taught as children that we don’t cut our hair unless we have experienced a significant loss, like the death of a close family member, traumatic event or significant life change. Tribes have different teachings about the value of hair and how to care for it. In our family, we are taught that our hair is a physical extension of all our thoughts, prayers, dreams, aspirations, experiences and history. When we cut our hair, it represents the end of something that once was and a new beginning. When we do have to cut our hair, it is never to be thrown away, but rather, burned with sage or sweetgrass in a ceremonial way. When our hair is burned, all of our thoughts, prayers, dreams, aspirations, experiences, and history rise to the Creator to be properly taken care of. We are then guided in the direction for our prayers to be answered. Throwing our hair away is a form of personal disrespect. So, when my Grandfather had his hair cut off and thrown away, his tears were of deep grief, confusion, helplessness, and shame. It was against everything he had ever been taught, along with grieving the loss of everything his hair represented to him. When this cultural practice was common in most Native communities, it was easy to recognize when someone in the community was grieving or experiencing a significant change in their life, because their long hair was no longer. With our hair embodying so much of who we are, boundaries are important. Touching someone’s hair without permission is disrespectful in the Native community. Some even find that asking permission is a form of disrespect, especially with children and elders. This is not something to take personal, it’s our way of protecting ourselves from the energy of someone we know nothing about. Does your family or tribe have special teachings about hair? We would love to hear and learn from you. Written by: Barbie Stensgar Colville Tribe - Arrow Lakes Band Photo Credit: (truncated)"

Once they have grown within their communities, they start to learn about real ""liberty and freedom"", and what working for yourself can provide. So then the democrats have to target American middle class citizens... while giving small special interest groups a bigger voice... all while playing a special little game of ""smoke and mirrors"" media hype.

The act required African Americans migrating to Ohio to prove they were free, required a $500 bond to guarantee good behavior and fined employers who dared to hire those who weren’t free. Measures followed that barred black residents from serving on juries and testifying against white defendants. Historian Leon F. Litwack wrote that no extensive effort was made to enforce the $500 bond requirement until 1829, when the rapid increase of the black population alarmed white officials in Cincinnati, who declared that African-American residents had to obey the Black Codes or leave within 30 days. After black residents appealed for more time, a white mob cut the time short, burning African-American neighborhoods and beating the residents. About half of the city’s black residents fled to Canada. Other states, including Indiana, Illinois and the Michigan Territory, followed with their own Black Codes."

The Congressional Oath of Office is a legally binding oath which includes the clause of protecting our nation from threats foreign and domestic. To IGNORE a substantiated, imminent threat to our nation is an undeniable breach of the oath... And, to risk our national security just so you can stack democrat-controlled areas with as many illegal aliens as possible prior to the 2020 Census goes beyond criminal to the point of traitorous.... For those that haven't heard it yet, here's Democratic Strategy for Congressional Control: The Democratic Party NEEDS as many illegal aliens in their democrat-controlled areas as possible prior to the 2020 US Census if they want to maintain their seats in the US Congress and if they have to Sacrifice thousands of Americans to achieve this goal, so be it!!! After the US Census(performed once every 10 years), the 435 seats in the US House of Representatives are divided up by state populations and the last one resulted in one seat for roughly every 770,000 people... Soooooooo, let's say California has about 4 MILLION non-citizens living there right now... That means that FIVE of their seats in the US Congress are due to people who are not Americans being counted in the Census!!! NOW, imagine if by 2020, when they do the next census, they had 10 MILLION non-citizens living in California.. That would mean California would get 10 SEATS in the US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES due to non-citizens... NOW, do you see why Democrats want Open Borders??? The Democrats found a way to get money and seats in Congress without even having to rig elections!!!"

THE REAL REASON DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS OPPOSE BORDER SECURITY Editorial by Kevin Ryan President Trump told the nation tonight why he wants $5 billion in funding for border barriers. Democrats are already criticizing his rationale, using talking points they’ve pushed over the past month, to explain their opposition. WALLS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE: Senator Schumer recently said that not a single Democrat “will support bilking the American taxpayer for an ineffective, unnecessary, and exorbitantly expensive wall.” The comment is beyond ironic coming from the leader of a party that supports hugely expanding the $4.4 trillion annual federal spending, much of which bilks the American taxpayer for ineffective, unnecessary, and exorbitantly expensive government programs. The $5 billion in border security that President Trump is asking for amounts to just 0.11% of the total budget. WALLS ARE IMMORAL: “A wall, in my view, is an immorality. It’s the least effective way to protect the border and the most costly. I can’t think of any reason why anyone would think it’s a good idea — unless this has something to do with something else,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said earlier this month. If walls are immoral, how do Democrats explain the billions they’ve spent to build barriers at the border in the past? If they’re immoral, should we tears down the hundreds of miles of fencing currently in place? WALLS ARE INEFFECTIVE: This is perhaps the most intellectually dishonest of all the reasons to oppose a border barrier. Walls are used to keep people out everywhere, from the big walled off estates that many of our politicians live in, to other countries’ borders. In Hungary, an electrified, barbed wire fence reduced illegal immigration by 99.7%. Israel erected a security fence after a rash of terror attacks by people illegally entering the country. The attacks all but ceased. Walls do work. Instead, the real reason Democrats suddenly oppose barriers is the same reason politicians oppose (or support) anything: politics. A year ago in January, Schumer offered to give Trump $25 billion for a wall in return for a pathway to citizenship for the 1.8 million DACA “dreamers”. According to PBS NewsHour, Schumer’s offer faced “scalding criticism from his party’s liberal activist base,” and he rescinded it just a few days later. Fast forward to last month. Schumer offered $1.6 billion in border security funding as part of the government spending bill. It triggered a wave of backlash from progressive Democrats, once again forcing Schumer to backpedal, writing that the money will not be allocated to a concrete wall. Trump critics then went even further, saying that “Trump could claim any funding, including to repair damaged border fencing, as a victory for the wall and the GOP.” Ever since then, Democratic politicians have insisted on zero funding for a wall, fence, or even border security. Strong border security, once a bipartisan issue, has become politicized.
