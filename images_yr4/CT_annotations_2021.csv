Dr. Vejar initially opened her business 8 years ago on East Merrimack Street, then moved to her current location at 70 Merrimack St. 5 years ago. In November, the Boutique will be celebrating its 5-year anniversary. Dr. Vejar graduated from Belmont High School and went to college to become an educator. Dr. Vejar has worked at Lowell High School for 25 years now. Lowell is rich in its history and culture with beautiful stores and annual festivals. Galeria De Los Andes is an expression of Dr. Vejar dreams. When Dr. Vejar and her mother moved to the United States and made that dream possible. Growing up and Ecuador, Dr. Vejar always wanted to have a Boutique that will showcase the beauty, style, and elegance of the Andes region. Dr. Vejar is very proud and grateful to the people who helped her with this opportunity. She is also very happy to be able to offer beautiful products, to showcase their creations and to share her dreams with her customers and friends. Due to COVID, Dr. Vejar noticed that people do not spend as much, therefore they had to reduce the price of their products, think outside the box, and re-strategize their business efforts. Last year, as there was not too much onsite shopping, Dr. Vejar and her husband delivered products within a 15-mile radius during Mother‚Äôs Day and Christmas time. Galleria de Los Andes Boutique was featured on Channel 5 in an article title, ‚ÄúShop Local: AromaSanctum & Galeria de Los Andes‚Äù in 2017. Dr. Vejar started the Maria Olimpia Meza (M.O.M.) Scholarship Fund two years ago. Vejar‚Äôs mother and best friend was an incredible woman, a ""real guerrera"" Her mother was proud of Dr. Vejar‚Äôs accomplishments, always emphasizing the importance of education. Some of her words of advice were: Never, ever, give up. Nunca te rindas. Always be kind- Siempre debes ser amable. Vejar‚Äôs mother passed away in October of 2018. To keep her memory alive, she created a scholarship in her name. The scholarship will help provide opportunities to students who cannot afford higher education. Donations can be sent to the Greater Lowell Community Foundation."

2021,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/images_yr4/2021/283133599838257.png,"THE RECORD COLD & SNOW ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH IS MAKING NEWS--BUT, AS IN CHICAGO, THE CURRENT COLD INTERRUPTS WHAT HAD BEEN A MILD WINTER FOR MONTHS LEADING INTO IT..... The bitterly cold air breaking records and making news with its disruptive snows had origins in Siberia in late January. It crossed the North Pole and brought an end to what had been an extraordinarily mild winter in may locations now shivering in the cold. Many of us in the meteorological profession had been shaking our heads at the complete lack of truly cold air (i.e. BELOW NORMAL TEMPS) across literally the entire North American continent in January. Then warming across the arctic from Greenland westward into northern North America produced critical jet stream ""buckling"" and steering winds were suddenly diving southward into the Lower 48. That's when the cold air arrived--and one of the stranger continent-wide North America blocking patterns developed and is responsible for the persistence of the cold we've seen for the past week and half. The ""blocking pattern"" is to break down across North America in the coming week and temps will bounce back--even return to the above normal state which had dominated the vast majority of winter up to the current cold air invasion. I'm posting 90-day plots of temps for some cities across the south--and note the huge drop in temps during the past 10 to 14 days--but also how temps had been more often than not ABOVE NORMAL in the period from November to the onset of the bitter cold. Also, thought you'd find a plot of the average temp departure across the country over the past 14 days. Compare that to the national temp departures the past 5 months (120 days)---and you can see how dramatic the current cold spell has been in dropping temps in the past 2 weeks. But also evident is that the cold of the past days stands out as MOST UNUSUAL in a ""cold season"" which got underway back in October but actually wasn't cold at all until the current arctic siege. BY THE WAY, THE PREDICTED TEMP DEPARTURES OFF TWO OF OUR GLOBAL MODELS ARE INCLUDED IN THE GRAPHICS BELOW. It will show how quite a turn around to FAR MORE MODERATE WINTER WEATHER is ahead for areas of the country which have been shivering and shoveling! That doesn't mean these area's will be snow-free----JUST NOT AS ABNORMALLY COLD."

If we focus ONLY ON FEBRUARY, 2021, notice that the month's water equivalent precipitation is just a fraction of normal over a wide area of the Midwest even as the snowfall tally was well above average of a wide swath of the region. It's a reflection of the high snow to water ratio which occurred in the month's snows---in other words, the ""fluffed-up"" nature of the snow because of the cold temps which dominated so much of the past month. The type of snowflake which falls in cold temps is quite voluminous (i.e. takes up more space than snowflakes which fall in warmer temps) even though the actual amount of water in the snow is sub-par. Also--check out the wonderful February 2021 Chicago temp/snowfall plot produced by AON Insurance meteorologist Steven Bowen. You look at this and realize nature took us on quite a ride during the past month with temps ranging from 7-below to 52-degrees this past Saturday, Fen 27---a stunning near 60-deg variation inside a span of less than 3 weeks!"

2021,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/images_yr4/2021/441798757312303.png,"A lot of people think of white supremacy as a group of people or a collection of historical events that include the Holocaust and American slavery. This mentality limits our perception of white supremacy as something that only a minority of people did to another minority of people, during a small window of time. But it's so, so much more than that. White supremacy includes centuries of opportunities made possible only because of Europe's racial superiority complex. If you can imagine the crime -- stolen land, Eugenics, human trafficking, financial exploitation, enslavement, full-blown colonization -- then you can be sure it's been done and justified under the umbrella of white supremacy. One of the ways we've whitewashed the violence of white supremacy (and thus preserved its venom) is through the naming of landmarks, schools, and cities after dead white supremacists. Naming schools after dead racists isn't just lazy creativity, it's also a form of historical gaslighting that sends a clear message to BIPOC: ""We built this city/school/building/country. This is OURS."" That's why it's so important when BIPOC activists protest to remove confederate monuments or rename schools named after colonizers. They're not just removing a sight for sore eyes. They're updating history by squashing the old narrative that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert E Lee were ""the good guys."" The recent discovery of mass graves of Indigenous people serves as a reminder that so many BIPOC lives were destroyed in order to create the world that white supremacists wanted to live in. They used our ancestors as free and cheap labor to build railroads, our highways, our factories, the White House itself, and our cities, then they discarded the bodies like rusted tools. We can't simply forget and overcome the history of white supremacy because we're still unearthing more and more of its dirty laundry."
