This is an aggressive reminder that this page was NEVER for Trump, but that doesn’t exactly mean we were ever political to begin with. When this page was made, we made a vow to not be your average positivity page, and that’s what we’ll continue to do. This is an important day in history no matter how you look at it and no matter what anger you hold. Kamala is a BLACK (Jamaican and Indian American with other mixes to her) woman who is now going to be the Vice President of the United States of America, who is paired up with Joe Biden, who was a Vice President himself, who also made history this election, so that is what we’re celebrating today. Negative, racist, and ignorant comments will be removed and you will be banned. This is not the place to spread foolishness and bully other people. We have a zero tolerance for such activities and will continue to make this a more safe place for people to visit. Also want to note that this is a bit controversial so we expect some silliness to ensue so this will be moderated heavily. We also know Biden and Harris are not the absolute greatest candidates ever with a questionable background but we still feel the need to look at the positive here and celebrate the history that has been made today. Another thing to note is that this is OFFICAL. The next President and Vice President have in fact been chosen."

2020,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/images_yr4/2020/219869462838568.png,"When it comes to Representation in Politics, Kamala Harris deserves a shit ton of credit for becoming the First Black Woman, the First South Asian Woman, and the First Asian American to become Vice President. Speaking from the perspective of an Asian American, this is a LANDMARK hurdle that's been overcome. Asian Americans often feel disconnected from our Political Process, so having a Vice President in office cut from our community's cloth will inspire new generations of Asian American politicians. Kamala's win also validates the dreams of many Asian American Political Science Majors, Organizers, and Activists who've wanted to pursue politics as a career but couldn't convince their parents that it was even possible. I have my criticisms of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' politics and their record as elected officials, and I'm not 100% sold that they will care about Asian Americans, but I'm committed to pushing Liberals towards more Progressive issues so they can TRULY represent our people -- whether we were born and raised in America or we immigrated. If we can maintain a fire under Trump's ass for 4 years so we can boot him out, we can maintain that same pressure to keep Biden and Harris in line with our community's needs. This win doesn't mean they're entitled to our support, it means we've agreed to offer support in exchange for them delivering on their promises. How do you feel about Kamala Harris becoming our new Vice President?"

With a ton of goal driven Capricorn energy in play, it’s going to serve us well to start making plans for the future. A lot possibilities will be coming into play helping us manifest our vision and begin building new initiatives…. brick by brick. Important headlines will also be coming onto the scene. These will come on a personal and global scale. The grand finale of Saturn and Pluto’s major collision will take place alongside a high energy = emotional Cancer Lunar Eclipse. Decisions will be necessary of what needs to stay … and what needs to go. With Mercury, the planet of communications, adding to the mix we can expect to see and hear all sorts of information as these radical shifts finally ramp up. By late January, a nice dose of Aquarius energy will come onto the scene and help us form new ideas into our next. Outside of the box solutions will be cropping up to help us embrace all our new shifts. Karmic twists of fate will also play part of the mix. Much of what is happening will be beyond our control but necessary in helping to take us into where we need to go next. Karmic contracts of the past are looking to be broken and rebuilds into our deepest drawbacks are looking to happen. It’s radical, life changing and necessary to the new blooms looking to grow.

It’s a decision to momentarily die to our flesh to fulfill the greater things of a mighty God who seeks us. We Surrender Our Comfort to Gain Spiritual Clarity Opens Our Hearts to Spiritual Revival Prayer and Fasting Breaks Satanic Strongholds When the Jesus’s disciples were unable to deliver a young boy of an evil spirit, Jesus told them, “This kind cannot come out, except by prayer,” (see Mark 9:29). Praying while fasting positions us victoriously. When you fast, pray more, read the word more, intake of the world less (anything negative, etc…..)

We must, with one last act of national authority, forever assure the empire of liberty in the country of our birth; we must take any hope of re-enslaving us away from the inhuman government that for so long kept us in the most humiliating torpor. In the end we must live independent or die. Independence or death… may these sacred words bind us and be the signal for battle and our reunion. Citizens, my countrymen, on this solemn day I have brought together those courageous soldiers who, as liberty lay dying, spilled their blood to save it; these generals who have guided your efforts against tyranny have not yet done enough for your happiness; the French name still haunts our land. Everything revives the memories of the cruelties by this barbarous people: our laws, our habits, our towns, everything still carries the stamp of the French. Indeed! There are still French in our island, and you believe yourself free and independent of that Republic which, it is true, has fought all the nations, but which has never defeated those who wanted to be free. What! Victims of our own credulity and indulgence for 14 years; defeated not by French armies, but by the pathetic eloquence of their agents’ proclamations; when will we tire of breathing the air they breathe? What do we have in common with this nation of executioners? The difference between its cruelty and our patient moderation, its color and ours the great seas that separate us, our avenging climate, all tell us plainly that they are not our brothers, that they never will be, and that if they find refuge among us, they will plot again to trouble and divide us. Native citizens, men, women, girls, and children, let your gaze extend on all parts of this island: look there for your spouses, your husbands, your brothers, your sisters. Indeed! Look there for your children, your suckling infants, what have they become?… I shudder to say it … the prey of these vultures. Instead of these dear victims, your alarmed gaze will see only their assassins, these tigers still dripping with their blood, whose terrible presence indicts your lack of feeling and your guilty slowness in avenging them. What are you waiting for before appeasing their spirits? Remember that you had wanted your remains to rest next to those of your fathers, after you defeated tyranny; will you descend into their tombs without having avenged them? No! Their bones would reject yours. And you, precious men, intrepid generals, who, without concern for your own pain, have revived liberty by shedding all your blood, know that you have done nothing if you do not give the nations a terrible, but just example of the vengeance that must be wrought by a people proud to have recovered its liberty and jealous to maintain it let us frighten all those who would dare try to take it from us again; let us begin with the French. Let them tremble when they approach our coast, if not from the memory of those cruelties they perpetrated here, then from the terrible resolution that we will have made to put to death anyone born French whose profane foot soils the land of liberty. We have dared to be free, let us be thus by ourselves and for ourselves. Let us imitate the grown child: his own weight breaks the boundary that has become an obstacle to him. What people fought for us? What people wanted to gather the fruits of our labor? And what dishonorable absurdity to conquer in order to be enslaved. Enslaved?… Let us leave this description for the French; they have conquered but are no longer free. Let us walk down another path; let us imitate those people who, extending their concern into the future, and dreading to leave an example of cowardice for posterity, preferred to be exterminated rather than lose their place as one of the world’s free peoples. Let us ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy our work; let us allow our neighbors to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under the laws that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary firebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean, nor let our glory consist in troubling the peace of the neighboring islands. Unlike that which we inhabit, theirs has not been drenched in the innocent blood of its inhabitants; they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that protects them.
