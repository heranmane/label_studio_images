Did you know that in 1790, there were reportedly 26 people enslaved in Litchfield? We often think of the south when we think about slavery, but the north also enslaved people. Two little girls were enslaved on North Street. Candace and Elvira (‚ÄúVira‚Äù) were gifted to Julius and Dorthoy Deming for their wedding from Dorothy‚Äôs father, Henry Champion. At just five-years-old, they had to leave everything and everyone they had ever known behind and make the journey from Colchester to Litchfield, following their new owners. When they were 22-years-old, they ran away. The ad pictured was placed in the newspaper in order to help encourage their capture and return. More is written and known about Vira than Candace, as she was frequently mentioned in the Demings‚Äô letters throughout the years. Surprisingly, she remained friendly with the Demings and was emancipated in 1801, around the age of 25. The Litchfield Historical Society has a letter that she wrote to Dorothy Deming in 1802, in which she talks about fashion, inquires about the new members of congress, and offers to send lobster and oranges to the Deming children. The Deming-Perkins Memorial Family History states that Vira went on to open a restaurant named ‚ÄòElvira‚Äôs‚Äô, which was reportedly joined to the Park Theater in New York City. You can learn more about Vira at the Litchfield Historical Society. In the African American experience there are countless tales of overcoming horrific pain and suffering while working to preserve human dignity. This story, sadly, is a part of our community‚Äôs history. Our intent is to always speak up and educate. We in no way agree with nor support the treatment of human beings in such a manner. Litchfield Magazine will strive to get the conversation right. We are committed to talking about important issues and to learning and growing with our readers.

Environmentalism is a movement that impacts all classes, colors, and demographics of society, yet there is a lack of diversity within the movement itself. People of color are strong supporters of environmental issues. Which makes sense as communities of color have a much higher risk of getting polluted and have historically been targeted as dumping sites for toxic waste. The 6th Annual Environmental Justice Summit will bring together leading BIPOC environmental organizers from the Bay Area and beyond.

Sanger, herself, said about her <Negro Project>, ""We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out the idea, if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members."" Sanger's mission was, also, to put Black doctors and nurses in charge of birth control clinics to reduce any mistrust of a racist health care system... and to gain the trust of the Black community. It seems her project is working... because more Black babies are aborted than any other race? Ask yourself... Why?... What's, Really, Going On?

This video will be a community collaboration focusing on our varying experiences under the theme of ""Trans Joy"". The trans and gender-diverse community is often asked to share their challenges and experiences to people who do not identify as trans. We find it important that we share a wide range of voices, identities, and celebrations. We would like to create an opportunity to discuss what visibility means from a positive, trans-centered perspective. If you know anyone who would like to share their experience with the community, please have them contact us at TransHealthLB@centerlb.org with the subject ""TDOV Video 2022"".

This year, the Virgin Islands Department of Education's Division of Virgin Islands Cultural Education is honoring eleven Afro Caribbean individuals who shaped the political and social environment of the United States. Arturo A Schomburg and Nella Larsen both have close ties to the Virgin Islands, having their parents originate in the Danish West Indies, also known as the Virgin Islands of the United States. Arturo A. Schomburg founded the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, a research library within the New York Public Library with a collection of over 11 million items. Additionally, Nella Larsen's works were recently resurrected in the black-and-white drama film Passing, which was released in 2021. The film is based on Nella Larsen's 1929 novel of the same name, and the title refers to African-Americans whose skin tone was light enough to be recognized as white, a condition known as ""passing."" The Division will include biographies of the following Caribbean activists, writers, entertainers, and visual artists throughout the month: Kwame Ture/Stokley Carmichael, Arturo A. Schomburg, Nella Larsen, Sidney Poitier, Marcus Garvey, Amanda Seales, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Grandmaster Flash, Edwidge Dandicat, and Roxanee Gay are all featured in the 2022 series."

This week's spotlight is on Kye Allums, a former college basketball player who bravely and openly came out as a transgender man in 2010. Since then, Kye has involved himself in supporting the community as a transgender advocate, public speaker, artist, and mentor to LGBT youth. By sharing openly sharing his story, Kye showed other trans and gender non-conforming youth that they are not alone in their journey, and certainly not the only ones with a trans experience. We believe that public figures sharing their experiences with identity, such as Kye did, can be valuable and instrumental in constructing a society that is accepting of all, regardless of identity or expression."

These communities of color are incarcerated at disproportionate rates nationwide. In 2019, 56 percent of the United States‚Äô prison population was Black or Latino, despite these groups making up only 32 percent of the overall population. Prison gerrymandering turns disparities in incarceration into disparities in representation; electoral maps do not reflect the true size of the largely Black and Latino urban communities. For example, according to the Texas Civil Rights Project, Harris County (containing the city of Houston) and Dallas County would likely have received an additional state house seat each if incarcerated people were counted at their homes. While these inequities have long existed, they have become magnified with the rise of mass incarceration starting in the 1970s."

From staging an armed takeover of a duck sanctuary for no apparent reason in 2016 (which left one man dead), to sending armed thugs to harass people at social justice events all through 2020 and 2021, to their ongoing shit fit in which they‚Äôve decided that a piece of cloth is somehow ‚Äútyranny‚Äù, PR has shown time and time again that they simply cannot behave themselves like adults. But recently they‚Äôve moved on from simply acting like children, to making children the almost exclusive target of their extremist behavior. As our readers know, back in February the militia held a week long mask protest in front of Redmond High School. They spent that week approaching other people‚Äôs children and attempting to lure them off campus with promises of coupons for McDonalds. Their goal was to get kids off school grounds so they could feed them fast food and far right propaganda. This behavior outraged Redmond parents, a great many of whom called and wrote the Redmond City Council begging for something to be done about this extremist group. But it unfortunately gets worse. Maria Dauenhauer, a former Bend La Pine School Board candidate, has decided to post a picture with the names of students of Summit High School in a Facebook group that is frequented by some of the most extreme right wing individuals locally. We won‚Äôt be sharing the picture as we do not want to jeopardize the safety of these kids anymore than it already has now. Maria‚Äôs issue? Seeing posters in a school that celebrate inclusivity, equity and anti racism. According to right wingers, any material that covers these subjects in a school setting is indoctrination and poisonous to youth. When asked to black out the childrens names by someone else in the group, Maria defended the choice to leave the kids names and stated the posters must come down or she won‚Äôt remove the names. When asked again, Maria stated they need to remove the posters before she will remove the names. Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt the only doxxing incident that happened yesterday involving local right wingers that claim to be about child safety. A well known and active member of the militia by the name of Brenda Parazoo (Brenda Coyle on FB), is an employee of the Bend Lapine School District, and she decided yesterday to doxx children as well in some ill informed attempt to rile up her bigot friends. Brenda Parazoo is Youth Transition Program Specialist. That job title alone makes what she did even more concerning. She chose to film kids protesting against racism outside of Mountain View High School, where she works, and zoom in on some of their faces while giving her own commentary on what she is witnessing. If I were a parent of a kid that has to interact with Brenda at school, I would pull my child immediately until something was done. For the safety of the kids involved in this incident, we will also not be posting that video. For years, the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Rights‚Äù militia have proven that they are a danger to this community, but more and more they are proving they are a specific danger to our kids and that is inexcusable. If you are a parent or someone involved with Mountain View High School and Summit High School, we encourage you to send each schools administration an email or make a phone call to voice your displeasure for the fact right wingers are doxxing children. We also recommend sending emails to the Bend La Pine School Board and Superintendent as this issue can not be ignored. Its one thing to doxx adults. Its a whole other ball game when you bring kids in to it like People‚Äôs Rights has. **Image is a black background tile with the logo for Bend Lapine Schools at the top, and the words ""CALL TO ACTION"" below it. Text reads ""Contact the Bend Lapine school superintendent and board. Ask them to protect our kids from far right extremists and racists. Demand that Brenda Parazoo be held accountable for her actions endangering children."" The Bend Lapine contact link is at the bottom, link in comments.*** #inbend #racism #militia #peoplesrights #bendlapineschools #PRO5"

He also worked in the USC-Upstate IT Department. After graduating, he initially went full-time into Christian ministry at USC-Upstate. After a few years of working with the ministry, he realized how much he enjoyed being on college campuses and how much he missed working in IT. And that led him to Limestone. He is currently pursuing his master‚Äôs degree in health informatics at Limestone. Leggett resides in Spartanburg, where he can often be found riding his bike downtown, enjoying coffee from Little River coffee shop, and exploring the area every chance he can get. He and his wife, Hilary, are parents to their 16-month-old daughter and they are expecting their second child to be born next month. ""February is a month where we get to talk about the accomplishments and successes of black people in America,‚Äù he said about the importance of Black History Month. ‚ÄúThose are stories that often go untold. There's been a lot of pain in the lives of African-Americans, and through that pain, a lot of joy has come."" A recent inspiration of his within the black community is author, Isabel Wilkerson. Her book, ‚ÄúThe Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration,‚Äù gave Leggett a better understanding of the impact that the Great Migration had on American history. It tells the story of black southerners migrating from the south ‚Äì which still heavily oppressed the black community ‚Äì to the north in search of better treatment and opportunities. However, they were still met with animosity throughout the country. Through perseverance and hard work, they were able to change the trajectory of America for the better.
