His mother, Jean, prepared savory soups and stews, fall-apart-tender meat, and kimchi fried rice for the family. Kim spent a year of the COVID-19 pandemic writing personal stories and cooking alongside his mother in her Georgia kitchen. The result is Korean American, a cookbook fusion of her Korean sohn mat (translated literally to ‚Äúhand taste,‚Äù meaning one‚Äôs signature touch and the perfect way to express why one‚Äôs food never tastes as good as the originator‚Äôs recipe) and the techniques that he‚Äôs acquired as an American food writer.

How true is this, though? Let‚Äôs take a moment to consider the experience of Cariol Holloman-Horne, a retired Buffalo Police Officer who was betrayed by her fellow colleagues in blue (as well as the broken system) when she stood up for a suspect experiencing deadly force. Cariol Holloman-Horne was a Buffalo police officer from 1988 to 2008. According to the report, during a 2006 call to aid an officer in trouble, she arrived at a scene where a suspect was under arrest by Officer Gregory Kwiatowski. Officer Horne noticed that her colleague then began to chokehold the suspect. You might recall that a chokehold was the same technique that was employed during the killing of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York City. When Officer Horne tried to remove Officer Kwiatkoski from this position, he let go of the suspect and responded by punching her in the face. The other officers at the scene closed ranks with Officer Kwiatkowski, alleging that she had endangered her fellow officer. An internal affairs investigation, however, found no wrongdoing on her behalf and offered her a four-day suspension. She did not accept this. Rather, she rejected this decision and in return, she was brought up on 13 departmental disciplinary charges. 11 stuck after a public hearing, and she was fired in 2008. From 2010 to 2021, Holloman-Horne fought the city of Buffalo for her pension to be reinstated. She finally won this right and has since become an advocate for police reform, as well as making ‚ÄúCariol‚Äôs Law‚Äù become the law across the country. It is a law that is supposed to ensure police officers face prosecution if they stand idle while a fellow officer uses excessive force, and protects them from retaliation by their fellow officers. History has taught us better, we don‚Äôt have any faith in this reform. When law enforcement officers take off their uniforms, they are just people with bias, intentions, and ideas. What does it say when any action to hold them accountable even by their own is met with retaliation? #cariolhollomanhorne #buffalo #police #gregorykwiatowski #policebrutality #policereform #systemofoppression #cantherebegoodcops #therearenobluelives #serveandprotectwho #bluewallofsilence #criminaljustice #abolition #blackbostonians #wethenorth #blackliberation #blm #blacklivesmatter #blmboston"

I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt share how significant this is to our country, but also how this idea of creating a more representative democracy has been central to my career. My public policy career launched when I was first appointed by former Governor Mark Dayton to sit on the nation's first ever Young Women's Cabinet in 2016. This cabinet advises the Governor on needed policies to ensure every young woman in the state of Minnesota has the opportunity to succeed and become the champion of their own life. In this role, I was elected to become co-chair, lead our annual legislative agenda, and receive appointment to the National Young Women's Advisory Council. This experience then led me to recognize the lack of representation of women, and especially women of color, in elected office. Determined to change this reality, I joined IGNITE National. IGNITE is one of the largest young women's political organizations dedicated to training the next generation of political leaders. In my role, I expanded IGNITE's presence across the Midwest and accelerated young women‚Äôs tools to run for elected office. - Raie Gessesse, 2021 Paul & Daisy Soros Fellow 1 - Selfie with members of the Young Women‚Äôs Cabinet with Governor Mark Dayton 2 - Photo of myself at a training for young women with Commissioner Irene Fernando 3 - Photo of myself speaking at YWCA annual celebration 4- Photo of myself at the Women‚Äôs Foundation of Minnesota annual Summit"

The country‚Äôs newest holiday ‚Äì it was signed into law last year - is regarded as the oldest known celebration commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. It honors what happened on June 19, 1865, when Union Army Major General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas with 2,000 federal troops, two months after the end of the Civil War, and read General Orders, No. 3, at different locations to officially inform ‚Äúthe people of Texas‚Äù that, ‚Äúin accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.‚Äù The order referenced President Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 that freed all slaves within ‚Äúany State or designated part of a State‚Äù where the people were ‚Äúin rebellion against the United States.‚Äù Texas was the last Confederate state where the proclamation, basically a temporary military decree, was enforced by Union forces arriving to take control of the state. Texas had approximately 200,000 slaves at the time and early reports of celebrations around ‚ÄúJuneteenth‚Äù referred to them as ‚Äútheir 4th of July.‚Äù Celebrations today include barbecues, the reading of the proclamation and discussions on further advancing racial equality in the country. The 13th amendment, abolishing slavery in the country as part of the Constitution, was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified by the necessary three-fourths of the states by December 6, 1865."

The virus has now been found in all four of the flyways across the United States. Around 26 states and more than 200 farms and backyard flocks have been impacted. If you have domestic outdoor birds, now is the time to implement your biosecurity protocols. This is particularly important if you live in a county or state where there are current avian influenza cases. Here are six tips to keep your flock safe. If you suffer even one positive case in your flock, your ENTIRE flock will be killed by state officials. The primary method for small backyard flocks is carbon dioxide gassing of birds. Keep your birds safe until the USDA and state officials give the all clear - which may be in June, when spring migrations have stopped. #avianinfluenza #hpai #h5n1 #chickens #turkeys #backyardchickens #vegan #veganism"
