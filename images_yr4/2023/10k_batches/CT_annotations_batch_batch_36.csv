Press into the pan evenly. It helps to put wax paper over the top so it doesn’t stick to your hands. * Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. * Let cool completely, it will harden more as it cools. Once it’s completely cooled, break it up with metal spatula or hands. If it’s still too soft after breaking up you can put it back in the oven for extra time. Remember not to bake it too long as it will crisp up more as it cools.    #glutenfree #highprotein #fitfood #weightloss #dieta #lchf #keto #lowcarb #ketogenic #ketosis #ketodiet #lowcarbhighfat #ketogenicdiet #paleo #ketofam #highfat #primal #lowcarbdiet #sugarfree #lowcarblifestyle #grainfree #paleodiet #ketolife #eatfatlosefat #ketochowrecipe"
