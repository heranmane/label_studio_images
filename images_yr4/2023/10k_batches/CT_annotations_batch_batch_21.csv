Our distributions have been our most consistent outreach projects since 2013. Our amazing Volunteers organize and execute the distributions, alternating between a mobile distribution and a stationary distribution. Currently, we are blessed with the ability to assist an average of 1,000 people per month; in multiple cities, in multiple states! Our goal with distributions since 2013, has been to provide essential necessities to those in need. Necessities that we may take for granted, are viewed as a luxury to those without. Some of the items we hand out include food, clothing, bottled waters, hygiene items, first aid supplies, socks, shoes, books, seasonal items, and lists of resources available in the area. We also utilize our time in the community, retrieving feedback of needs and issues, by those in need. Engaging with individuals, learning their stories, and providing them hope. Our distributions continually evolve. Addressing needs, while making available the proper resources. Tangible donations are the lifeblood of our distributions. Your contribution of any of the items below, help to ensure each and every distribution is effective and impactful. Learn how you can help us by donating, or volunteering, by contacting us at any time. www.WhoIAmFoundation.org:=:https://www.whoiamfoundation.org/ #TeamWhoIAm"

By the beginning of 1945, the German army had been weakened and defeat looked likely. Tuesday 8 May, 1945, was an emotional day that millions of people had been waiting for. Many people were extremely happy that the fighting had stopped and there were big celebrations and street parties. Huge crowds - with lots of people dressed in red, white and blue - gathered outside Buckingham Palace in London. They cheered as King George VI and his family, including Princess Elizabeth (the current queen) and Princess Margaret, came out onto the balcony to greet everybody. Princess Elizabeth and her sister were allowed to leave the palace and celebrate with crowds outside, although they had to do it secretly. The future Queen described it as ""one of the most memorable nights of my life"". But VE Day was also a moment of great sadness and reflection, as millions of people had lost their lives or loved ones in the conflict. Many had to continue fighting in other battles and lots of people were being kept as prisoners of war abroad. ""Our rejoicing is sobered and subdued by a supreme consciousness of the terrible price we have paid to rid the world of Hitler and his evil band. Let us not forget, my fellow Americans, the sorrow and the heartache, which today abide in the homes of so many of our neighbors - neighbors whose most priceless possession has been rendered as a sacrifice to redeem our liberty.""

We will continue to raise as we have programs and assistances that we are putting together and need funding for. Last winter, we were able to help assist 4 families through the holidays. This year we are aiming to not only offer the assistance, but to offer continuing advocacy. We are looking at more ways to continue to partner the two organizations as we want you to feel good when supporting our business knowing that a part of your money is going to impact the greater good. We thank you again for everyone who has attended or will be attending this weekend. We've got a few slots left over so if you're still interested, send us a message and let's get you registered!
