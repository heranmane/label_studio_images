Although our rural tri-county area seems removed from hubs of human trafficking such as Los Angeles, the Bay Area and Sacramento, there is still human labor trafficking and human sex trafficking occurring here in our local communities. Human trafficking relies on isolation, coercion, fear and threats. Many victims of human trafficking do not initially know that they are being trafficked. California is ranked 7th in the nation for rate of cases of human trafficking, with 3.80 cases per 100,000 residents. As the most populous state in the nation, California has the highest number of total reported cases. In 2021 there have been 1,507 reported cases of human trafficking in California, with many cases going unreported and unrecognized. If you suspect someone is the victim of human trafficking call the National Human Trafficking Resource Center 1-888-373-7888 The resource center involves law enforcement only with the consent of the victim who may have reasons why they do not feel safe or comfortable involving authorities. For more information visit: humantraffickinghotline.org/report-trafficking:=:https://humantraffickinghotline.org/report-trafficking If the situation involves a minor or someone is in immediate physical danger, call 911. Also visit https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign for more information and resources.

We want to highlight a few of the most important women in the history of #publichealth! Dr. Alice Hamilton saved countless workers’ lives as a pioneer in industrial health and safety. Beginning in the 1890s, she treated working-class immigrant patients at Hull House in Chicago. She learned about how diseases, toxic chemicals, and workplace injuries hurt poorer people the most. Dr. Hamilton fought to end these disparities. She investigated companies' safety records and pushed for stronger worker protections. She also promoted the peace movement and women’s rights. In 1919, Dr. Hamilton became the first woman on the faculty at Harvard University. Read more about her life here: https://www.nps.gov/people/dr-alice-hamilton.htm"

Throughout the 1960's, she provided safe abortions in heavily-restricted Tennessee.

Dr. Brown's influence on Black women in medicine, abortion, and racial equality continues to live on. 🟨 Loretta J. Ross is a pioneer in the reproductive justice movement and one of the first to coin the now-commonly used ""women of color"" and ""reproductive justice"" frameworks. She served as director for organizations such as the National Organization for Women and the National Black Women's Health Project. Ross now uses her vast experience in reproductive justice to speak and teach about human rights as well as issues such as white supremacy and ""call-out culture."" 🟩 Monica Simpson is the current Executive Director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective.

We wanted her to understand and see what was going on. Why people were protesting, what it all means. I've been talking to a lot of my African American friends and I shared with her their comments word for word. I want her to understand that she shouldn't be scared to join with others to support justice and equality. That first amendment rights are there for a reason. That silence in matters of justice and conscience is death, literally and figuratively. She has people in her life who are African American, people she thinks of as uncles and aunties and friends. I need her to understand that their reality is ours, we're just on the other side because of privilege- and that means we're obligated to do something. And one of the things I'm doing is trying to raise her with her eyes open to what she has going for her as a white person and what she has to do with it.

Not looting and rioting- especially by people bused in from out of state just to create chaos and distract from what is actually going on- which has nothing to do with what I was talking about or what I took my daughter to or what I would urge her to do. Emotions are running high right now. I understand that. It is for that reason that I'm adding this ETA."

She was working at Action AIDS when Bob Michaels, then CEO of LRI, asked her to return to develop clustered living. Later, Cassie served as the Director of CIL Services and later, as the Director of National Policy. Cassie continues to support the CIL by serving on the Board of Directors.

The support has been overwhelming and we do anticipate a complete sell-out. With only 200 in-person tickets available, and 1,000 virtual tickets, it’s important our guests walk away empowered and return to their wedding business feeling supported and educated to be a leading advocate for engaged LGBTQ+ couples. Delivering a higher expectation from all partnering vendors,” explains Ric. We have created an event that will allow for relationship building and networking. Additional tickets are available for purchase to select events. The Hyatt Regency Indian Wells Resort & Spa will host conference attendees as they kick off the 3-day event with a welcome dinner & reception. Day 1 will be hosted by Cathy O’Connell, COJ Events & NGWA President. Join Cathy with inclusive speakers, advocates, and wedding industry leaders to take a close look through the eyes of an LGBTQ+ couple. Learn how to style a photo shoot, use proper hashtags, and more in one of the afternoon breakout sessions. Day 2, join our host Vice President & A Monique Affair founder, Chanda Daniels. Join Chanda along with her panel of guests and speakers, develop the plan to grow your wedding business by increasing your inclusive business practices. The conference itinerary will take the attendees on a journey of understanding inclusiveness and inclusive business practices, focusing on one basic concept: love. Listen and learn from our panelists of leading LGBTQ+ advocates and wedding industry leaders. Please visit our website for more information. Both in-person and virtual conference attendees will receive an Inclusive Awareness Certificate of attendance issued by the National Gay Wedding Association.

The National Gay Wedding Association is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that offers professional and educational resources for Professional Wedding Creatives that are invested in implementing inclusive practices for LGBTQ+ couples. In the wedding industry, we must learn the appropriate language to talk about queer couples, understand innovative and new wedding traditions, and reimagine the institution of marriage as it has existed for millennia. As advocates, we must continue to pursue equality for queer people across cultures, and acquire new resources to support and uphold these standards. For LGBTQ+ couples, we provide a network of established inclusive-minded Professional Wedding Creatives and LGBTQ+ advocates who provide invaluable experience to engaged couples.

Mordecai Bartley orders three infantry regiments of the Ohio Militia into service for the Mexican War. Bartley’s call read in part, “Let it not be said that when our country appeals to the courage and patriotism of the citizen soldiers of Ohio for aid that that aid was not properly rendered.” Ohio military forces were organized into five infantry regiments, 15 independent companies of infantry and one company of mounted rifleman. So many Buckeyes answered the call that five companies were supplied to the Fifth United States Infantry. In the end, there were about 7,000 officers and men in the Mexican War from Ohio, which constituted about one-eighth of the entire land forces of the United States. This 1862 photo shows Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis who was the adjutant general of Ohio at the outbreak of the Mexican War. After establishing Camp Washington near Cincinnati as a general rendezvous of the Ohio Militia, Curtis resigned his post to command the 3rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the war.

It is important to understand Chinese-American or AAPI is not one single group, but it is a mixture of wonderful cultures coming together to be a part of this country, this United States of America. So much has been shaped by my parents, family, friends and my Chinese heritage, but also by my American Culture. I am very proud of my Chinese heritage but I am also proud to be an American. My favorite part about being a person of multi-culture: being able to help those that are in similar situations as I am, and it is a unifying feeling.

Here tells a candid, unself-pitying story of triumph and endurance in the face of hardships relentlessly reinforced by the apartheid system. We continue to celebrate the writing and achievements of Sefi Atta, award-winning author including the two books pictured here. “Swallow”, recently adapted for a Netflix film, is a powerful tale that looks back at Lagos in the 1980s. “The Bad Immigrant,” Sefi’s most recent novel, is a comment on the immigrant experience. In particular, this book peels away nuanced layers to expose the realities of migration from Nigeria to the USA, such as the strains of adjustment and the stifling pressure to conform without loss of identity. If you are not already aware, the Caine Prize for African Writing is the leading African Literary Award—known as the African Booker—named after the Booker Prize Founder, Michael Caine. “20 Years of The Caine Prize for African Writing” showcases the winning short stories of African writers from the past 20 years and reflect the vast range of modern African experience.
