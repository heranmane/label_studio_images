When the honor student arrived, he pulled in the driveway and walked up to the front door to get his younger twin brothers. The boy described as ""well-mannered"" and a ""kind soul"" rang the bell. He had no idea he had gone to the wrong house — he’d gone to N.E. 115th St. instead of N.E. 115th Terrace, police said, Fox 4 reports. He was then ""shot in front of the residence by the homeowner,"" Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said at a press conference Sunday.

Likewise, God’s Spirit no longer dwells in Temples or Tabernacles—it dwells in us! For through Christ we have been reconciled to God and declared righteous in His sight. 🙌 On this Good Friday, let us thank Jesus Christ for what He accomplished on the cross. The curtain is torn!

He is dyslexic. His dream of becoming a hockey player was shattered by a serious accident. His daughter died at birth. His wife died in a car accident. His best friend, River Phoenix, died of an overdose. His sister has leukemia. And with everything that has happened, Keanu Reeves never misses an opportunity to help people in need. When he was filming the movie ""The Lake House,"" he overheard the conversation of two costume assistants; One cried because he would lose his house if he did not pay $20,000 and on the same day Keanu deposited the necessary amount in the woman's bank account; He also donated stratospheric sums to hospitals. In 2010, on his birthday, Keanu walked into a bakery and bought a brioche with a single candle, ate it in front of the bakery, and offered coffee to people who stopped to talk to him. After winning astronomical sums for the Matrix trilogy, the actor donated more than $50 million to the staff who handled the costumes and special effects - the true heroes of the trilogy, as he called them. He also gave a Harley-Davidson to each of the stunt doubles. A total expense of several million dollars. And for many successful films, he has even given up 90% of his salary to allow the production to hire other stars. In 1997 some paparazzi found him walking one morning in the company of a homeless man in Los Angeles, listening to him and sharing his life for a few hours. Most stars when they make a charitable gesture they declare it to all the media. He has never claimed to be doing charity, he simply does it as a matter of moral principles and not to look better in the eyes of others. This man could buy everything, and instead every day he gets up and chooses one thing that cannot be bought: To be a good person. Keanu Reeves’ father is of Native Hawaiian descent."

In 2010, on his birthday, Keanu walked into a bakery and bought a brioche with a single candle, ate it in front of the bakery, and offered coffee to people who stopped to talk to him. After winning astronomical sums for the Matrix trilogy, the actor donated more than $50 million to the staff who handled the costumes and special effects - the true heroes of the trilogy, as he called them.

The ""bars"" spoken of here (Nahum 3:13), from the Hebrew word briyach, are beams that lock gates (or doors), keeping out intruders at night or from attack. The problem in our time is this is past tense; our gates are already wide open, and the intruders (enemies foreign and domestic) are already among us attacking. They (the attackers) are unopposed by our so-called defenders, leaders who've become like women (effeminate: weak, in fear, and hiding {in their holes}). It is of this (antichrist attack) chapter 2 speaks using terms to which the LORD refers in Matthew 12, telling us both passages speak of our time. Nahum 2 1 He [the antichrists mixed among us destroying us] that dashes [your children] in pieces is come up before your face [doing it in your presence, while you stand still watching]: keep the munition, watch the way, make your loins strong, fortify your power mightily. 2 For the LORD has turned away the excellency [ga'own – the arrogancy of those who lead the remnant] of Jacob, as the excellency [ga'own – destroyed by the same arrogance against the LORD] of Israel [our countrymen now allied with our enemies {their enemies, of which they are ignorant} and gathered against us inside out gates {destroying themselves with us, of which they are also ignorant}]: for the emptiers [baqaq – a nine times used word referring to its uses by Isaiah and Jeremiah foretelling its coming] have emptied [baqaq] them out, and marred their vine branches [and the strength and life that once flowed from its good foundation is decayed and become their sources of weakness and confusion]. 3 The shield of his [the antichrists'] mighty men [gibbowr – as giants in the land] is made red [with the blood of those they've slaughtered], the valiant [chayil – the strength of the LORD returning to Levi – as in Deuteronomy 33:10 They {the children of Levi, the priests who have received this word of the LORD as His word} shall teach Jacob {all God's people as ONE BODY} your judgments, and Israel your law: they shall put incense before you, and whole burnt sacrifice upon your altar.11 Bless, LORD, his substance {chayil - the LORD's strength in and through him}, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.] men are in scarlet [as the LORD in him rises to the battle]: the chariots shall be with flaming torches [the word of God coming from their mouths] in the day of his preparation [kuwn – of their defense, which is spoken of in Nahum 1:15, coming from the one ""bringing good tidings and publishing peace""], and the fir trees [the places of the so-called {now falsely} upright] shall be terribly shaken [and the wicked shall be shaken from them]. 4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings [giving this understanding the LORD has given them]. 5 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defense shall be prepared [kuwn]. 6 The gates of the rivers [this word from the LORD] shall be opened, and the palace [of the wicked in power] shall be dissolved. 7 And Huzzab [natsab – the wicked stationed there] shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves [the sign of the end reached, as the sign of Jonah {dove}, when God's people as the men of Nineveh rise and stand in condemnation of the spiritually wicked sitting in power, and calling all to repent and receive the preparation, the good tidings and peace of the LORD at His now appearing and kingdom], tabering upon their breasts [playing the song the LORD has given them to be repeated as received]. 8 But Nineveh is of old [yowm – is as the coming sunrise of the new day] like a pool of water [where this word of God is now gathered into His message, making know His plan for the salvation to those who hear and receive Him]: yet they shall flee away [nuwc – those now stationed there shall flee away as locust flee at sunrise]. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back [panah – darkness {ignorance as policy} shall not remain when the light is covering the earth, when the preparation of the messenger is seen]. 9 Take you the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture. 10 She [the old earth] is empty [buwqah], and void [mbuwqah – what emptiness?], and waste [balaq – answering the question by referring us to the word's only other use, in Isaiah 24:1 below]: and the heart melts, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness. 11 Where is the (truncated)"

Wilson born on March 15, 1825 is considered the first woman of African and American descend to become a novelist, as well as the first Black person of any gender to publish a novel on the North American continent. Her fictional autobiography Our Nig; or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, in a Two-story White House, North was published anonymously in 1859 in Boston, Massachusetts, and was not widely known. The novel was discovered in 1982 by the scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Much of what is known about the life of Harriet Wilson has been derived from the book, which up until the early 1980s was considered the work of a white author. The largely autobiographical book turned the literary world on its end because up to that point it had been widely accepted that the first Black published novelist had been Frances Ellen Watkins Harper with Lola Leroy or Shadows Uplifted (1892). The Harriet Wilson Project commissioned a statue of Wilson in 2006. Sculpted by Fern Cunningham, the statue is located in Milford, New Hampshire's Bicentennial Park. Harriet E Wilson died on June 28, 1900"

2023,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/images_yr4/2023/224044939996495.png,"Native Encampment In the mid-1600's the Ojibwa east of Lake Superior began to move westward, and by the late 1770's, Ojibwa settlements circled Lake Superior. One of these settlements was located on the Kaministikwia River. Eye-witness accounts of Fort William in the early 1800's usually mention a Native encampment east of the palisade. A painting dated 1805 shows clusters of dome-shaped wigwams huddled at the south-east corner of the Fort; illustrations from the Hudson's Bay Company period (after 1821) depict conical tepees and wigwams. These habitations reflect the culture of a people continually adapting to their environment as they had for thousands of years. Ojibwa family groups moved through these woodlands around Lake Superior in a seasonal round that included fishing, hunting, and gathering, and trade gatherings with other Native groups. With the coming of the Europeans, many Ojibwa incorporated the demands of the fur trade: trapping fur-bearing animals, and more prolonged contact with trading posts to supply pelts and other services. The Ojibwa inhabiting the western Lake Superior region were also known as the Saulteaux, or Chippewa, while to the north were the Cree. Probably both tribes were represented at Fort William during the Rendezvous when Natives from surrounding areas came to trade their furs and exchange their labour and produce for commodities available at the Indian Shop. While most Natives departed for their hunting grounds as summer ended, some stayed behind to participate in winter activities of the fort. During the NWC period, there were probably about 150 Ojibwa living in the Kaministikwia district. A number of Ojibwa names appear quite regularly in the Fort William transaction records, probably the members of the Ojibwa community adjacent to the fort. It is probable that they based their operations at Fort William, but continued to undertake seasonal journeys and encampments for the purpose of harvesting maple sugar, wild rice, snaring rabbits, fishing, and hunting game. One of these expeditions might last weeks or even months, so the Ojibwa population at Fort William was constantly in flux. In addition to their own activities, the Ojibwa at Fort William supported the operation of the post. Women worked in the kitchen and canoe sheds, as well as the farm, and received payment in the form of trade goods. Men might be engaged in hunting or fishing for the NWC, and any other service in labour or expertise that the company might require. As producers, the Ojibwa were integral to the needs of the NWC at Fort William. The transaction records show the quantity of provisions and materials supplied to the post and its personnel: bark, wattap and spruce for canoe-building, snowshoes, moccasins, skins, maple sugar, berries, wild rice, and fresh game."

She found herself at a kill shelter in Tennessee and was on the euth list. Zen Rescue pulled her and she was sent to Sheree, our wonderful foster in IL. She then made her way to us by very kind volunteers that transported her all the way here. Ruthie is so tiny, if the wind blows she really almost falls over. She is in pretty bad shape already and quite the tiny senior gal. Ruthie is hypoglycemic due to her tiny tea cup size. Her body doesn't have enough reserved calories to last her through the day which can then cause her to crash. She takes lactulose as a preventative three times a day to keep her sugars up. She also eats small meals through the day to help her get a larger caloric intake. She does love to eat! Ruthie doesn't have any teeth left in her mouth but at one point they were so rotten and diseased it is just all decay matter now. She has many fistulas which open a straight path into her sinuses and we have to be very careful with her. She also has a grade two heart murmur and needs lots of special individualized care.

She loves to be with all the smaller little dogs snuggling and under warm blankies. Welcome home Ruthie! We love you already 💗🐾🐶"

Indian sign language (1954) From The Golden Digest, Issue 1 (1954) Once we had many Indian tribes in our country. They did not all speak the same language. But with sign language, one tribe could understand another. Here are some things they would say. Words shown: Sunset, yes, I/me/my, go/go away, horse/horse rider, buffalo, man, rising sun, tipi, you, night"

The corn and bean story is such a story. Corn was a tall, slender, and very handsome plant. He stood in a choice section of the garden. Most of the time Corn was happy to look at his beautiful surroundings, like the sunrise and sunset. He loved to watch the animals as they scurried about their business. Sometimes he'd feel a little sad, although he didn't know why. One evening as he watched the sunset change from orange to red to purple, he noticed two butterflies fluttering around each other. He noticed how they brushed each other's wings as they flew by. Suddenly, Corn knew what brought his occasional sadness. He missed the closeness and companionship of a family. He sang the song of loneliness as the sun slipped below the horizon. As the morning sun awakened the world, Corn saw that the Squash Maiden had made her way towards him. She told him she had heard his song and came to offer her companionship. Corn immediately saw their differences and explained, ""Megwetch. You are a beautiful plant, but we cannot grow together. You must wander all over the ground while I must stand in one place. Your broad leaves block the sun from the young ones beneath you. I grow tall and thin to share the sunlight."" The slender Bean heard this and planted herself next to Corn. Her slender threadlike vines spread out as if to feel for something to lean on. She touched Corn and wrapped herself around the stalk. They grew tall together. They knew this was the union that was meant to be. They promised to be together forever. So that the promise of Corn and Bean will never be broken, the Ahnishnahbe always plant beans next to corn to this day."

This sweet elderly boy came to us from the Kansas City KS Animal Shelter. He was found wandering by himself out at a lake. No one ever came to claim Sam and he needed hospice care. He was unstable and very ill. Quite nutritionally depleted whether from being abandoned or a stray. He had been throwing up blood and had blood in his stool as well. We immediately started him on an antibiotic as well as an intestinal antibiotic, pain medications and an appetite stimulant. As sick as he was he only wanted love. He adored pets, food, and to be a part of everyone. Following us around just to be by your side. As the days have passed Sam has grown weaker and the dementia has grown stronger. Making him pace more. He forgot how to drink and no longer wanted to eat. He truly would drop it out of his mouth without knowing to chew. Even with giving him fluids and supplemental liquid meals Sam's body was tired. His mind stopped telling him he was hungry and his body was beginning to shut down. Sam was having trouble walking and his back legs began knuckling. His body and soul were ready. Today, the sweetest good boy was set to peace. The peace he so greatly deserved and earned. We don't have a long back story with Sam all that we know is he was the bestest boy anyone could have loved. He laid down today on his favorite giant bed at the sanctuary with all of us gathered around him. He couldn't lift his head but he knew we were all gathered showering him with love. This afternoon, he left a body that was diseased and failing behind him. Set free of confusion and pain now running in freedom. Sam we didn't get to love you as long as we wanted but we got to walk you home sweet boy. Run free. 🌈🐾💙🐶"

This tiny little girl was so fragile and frail yet she kept fighting and proving how strong her spirit was. She was all of three pounds but she didn't let that stop her from telling all the others what to do or to move out of her heated bed. Chicken was a super senior that had been in a high kill shelter in Georgia and on the euthanasia list. She was saved by another rescue and put in foster for several years. She never found a home of her own during that time and desperately needed care as she had aged. She was sent on a transport and made her way to Whispering Willows as her last and final hospice home. Chicken immediately was given pain medications, nutritional supplements, appetite stimulants, antibiotics for her rotting mouth, and eye medications. She was blind with one completely underdeveloped eye and the other eye had already lost sight. Chicken had all of one tooth. The rest of her teeth had previously rotted out. Leaving decay and a jaw that was also decaying, losing strength. However, Chicken continued on eating her soft food diet and loving her life. Now fully loved and ""seen"". As time has progressed her jaw became so decayed it no longer allowed her to eat and everyday life was too much to overcome. We set her free, leaving this world of its cruelness and her diseased body. No longer suffering. We were so proud of her for her progress. She also loved to be held and adored fluffy blankets. We always had to check blankets just in case she was the wrinkle under one. We will miss this sweet brave soul. She exhibited more strength than any of us could have managed in her little body. Fly high Chicken little you deserve your freedom.🩷🐾😇🌈"

She was best known for her role as Prissy in the 1939 MGM movie ""Gone with the Wind."" Butterfly, which she changed her legal name to, was a lifelong atheist except for her childhood religious indoctrination. The role of Prissy, she would later say, ""was not a pleasant part to play — I didn't want to be that little slave. But I did my best, my very best."" She quit movie acting in 1947 to avoid further typecasting, going to work as a real-life maid, Macy's sales lady and seamstress. She earned her bachelor's degree in political science in 1974 at age 64 from the New York City College. Butterfly became the Freedom From Religion Foundation's premiere Freethought Heroine in 1989 and was an FFRF Life Member.

Barry was constantly with Zina because his separation anxiety kept him from being alone (without people) for any amount of time. He was at the PAWvillions every day in Zina and Michael's office. Barry was a grouchy ol' teddy bear who enjoyed sitting on the porch and taking long naps. Life in the Home Gang just won't be the same without Barry.

Shortly after Rock was born, his father, a truck driver and his mother, a teacher, moved to New York City. Rock was raised in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn along with an older half-brother and three younger brothers. Rock’s parents, hoping it would improve his education, arranged to bus him to a different neighborhood, where he attended an almost entirely white public high school. He was subjected to racist bullying and harassment, and ended up dropping out, later earning a GED. Comedic great Eddie Murphy discovered Rock performing stand-up in 1983 when Rock was just 18. In 1990 he joined the cast of ""Saturday Night Live"" and began appearing in bit roles in movies. He stayed with ""SNL"" for three years. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Rock’s stand-up was featured in five HBO specials. He hosted the 77th Academy Awards in 2005 and the 88th in 2016. He has won four Emmy Awards and three Grammy Awards. He was voted the fifth-greatest stand-up comedian in a poll conducted by Comedy Central. Rock’s grandfather was a preacher and Rock says he was influenced by his performance style on the altar. However, that influence did not extend to religion. Rock’s comedy is peppered with skepticism about religion, including an episode of HBO’s “The Chris Rock Show” in which he visited with different faith leaders in a bit that mocked several major religions. He directed and starred in the movie “Top Five” in 2014. His acting career also includes appearances in movies such as “Dogma” (1999), “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,” (2001), “Grown Ups,” (2010) and ""Grown Ups 2"" (2013). Netflix announced in 2016 that it would release two new stand-up specials, with Rock being paid $40 million per special. The first, ""Chris Rock: Tamborine,"" was released in February 2018 and was filmed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He married Malaak Compton in 1996. They divorced in 2016 and have two daughters, Lola Simone (born 2002) and Zahra Savannah (born 2004). Source: https://ffrf.org/news/day"

2023,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/images_yr4/2023/576612461323947.png,"Keanu Reeves was abandoned by his father at 3 years old and grew up with 3 different stepfathers. He is dyslexic. His dream of becoming a hockey player was shattered by a serious accident. His daughter died at birth. His wife died in a car accident. His best friend, River Phoenix, died of an overdose. His sister has leukemia. And with everything that has happened, Keanu Reeves never misses an opportunity to help people in need. When he was filming the movie ""The Lake House,"" he overheard the conversation of two costume assistants; One cried because he would lose his house if he did not pay $20,000 and on the same day Keanu deposited the necessary amount in the woman's bank account; He also donated stratospheric sums to hospitals. In 2010, on his birthday, Keanu walked into a bakery and bought a brioche with a single candle, ate it in front of the bakery, and offered coffee to people who stopped to talk to him. After winning astronomical sums for the Matrix trilogy, the actor donated more than $50 million to the staff who handled the costumes and special effects - the true heroes of the trilogy, as he called them. He also gave a Harley-Davidson to each of the stunt doubles. A total expense of several million dollars. And for many successful films, he has even given up 90% of his salary to allow the production to hire other stars. In 1997 some paparazzi found him walking one morning in the company of a homeless man in Los Angeles, listening to him and sharing his life for a few hours. Most stars when they make a charitable gesture they declare it to all the media. He has never claimed to be doing charity, he simply does it as a matter of moral principles and not to look better in the eyes of others. This man could buy everything, and instead every day he gets up and chooses one thing that cannot be bought: To be a good person. Keanu Reeves’ father is of Native Hawaiian descent ❤️ Thank you for reading and liking the article.
