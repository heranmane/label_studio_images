Although famous for her iconic buildings at the Grand Canyon, her story has been somewhat overlooked. Mary was born in Pittsburgh in 1869 to Irish immigrant parents who moved around somewhat until settling in St. Paul when she was eleven. These moves and the time her family spent in Colorado and Texas may have influenced Mary‚Äôs style and her love of Native American art. Mary graduated from Central High School at only fourteen, then went to California for college. She returned to St. Paul to teach drawing literature and other subjects at Mechanic Arts High School for fifteen years, helping to build the school into an important center for the Arts & Crafts Movement. She was then hired to design buildings and interiors for the Fred Harvey Company at the Grand Canyon. Influenced by her passion and respect of Native American art and culture, these buildings are now on the National Register of Historic Places, and are some of the most iconic buildings that grace our National Parks. Also an artist in her own right, Mary became known for skill and design in Arts & Crafts style metalworking. Even after moving to Kansas City, Mary Coulter retained close ties to Minnesota, teaching at the University of Minnesota-Extension, setting up exhibitions, and reviewing books and staying in touch with friends, including former Mechanic Arts principal George Weitbrecht. Mary Coulter died in 1958 at her house in Santa Fe. Image: Mary Colter (right) in about 1935, discussing plans for Bright Angel Lodge with Miner Tillotson (left), superintendent of the Grand Canyon National Park, and Anna W. Ickes, the wife of Harold Ickes, Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs secretary of the Interior, and an advocate for the culture, archeology, and welfare of Native Americans.
