They performed duties that were essential to the success of Sam Houston’s legacy until becoming freed citizens with emancipation. Exhibit is on display at the Katy & E.

New release Tuesday! 😀 We’ve paired each book with a few similar titles to give you an idea of what’s inside 🦊 BOMB SHELTER by @marylauraphilpott : The author of “I Miss You When I Blink” returns in a gorgeously gut-wrenching memoir about our protective instincts - and the limits of the human body and mind. Read along as Philpott illuminates (often hilariously) what it means to throw a grenade at your own heart. TAKE MY HAND by @dolenperkinsvaldez : Montgomery, Alabama, 1973: New nurse Civil Townsend is determined to help the women in her community take control of their bodies. But when she’s tasked with providing birth control to two girls who have never even kissed a boy, Civil is forced to reckon with the real-world consequences of her care. THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COLOR by #jamesfox : A vivid exploration of seven elemental colors that reveals our unique and ever-shifting relationship with color. This is a vibrant celebration of how color reflects and shapes a culture’s hopes, fears, and prejudices. TRUE: THE FOUR SEASONS OF JACKIE ROBINSON by #kostyakennedy : a probing and richly researched account of one of baseball’s most significant figures. The book’s focus on four transformative years in the legend’s life - 1946, 1949, 1956, and 1972 - makes for a vividly unconventional biography.

Content warning: contains mention of violence against Asian women A little over a year ago, a white man entered a massage parlor in the suburbs of Atlanta and open fired, killing 8 and wounding another. He cited a sexual addiction to Asian women as his motivation for his killing spree. His actions reflected centuries of imperialist, gendered violence towards Asian women. This tragedy sparked the “Stop Asian Hate” movement. This movement was meant to draw attention to the rise in anti-Asian, particularly anti-Chinese sentiment fueled by COVID-19 rhetoric and ongoing anti-Chinese messaging from American media. While this uptick in violence is more visible because of social media, xenophobic rhetoric degrading Asian communities in the US dates back centuries. “Stop Asian Hate” was trending on social media after the shooting and calls for anti-hate crime legislation began growing. However, these anti-hate crime bills were not written to protect the most vulnerable in Asian communities (those who are undocumented, don’t speak English, elders, refugees, etc), nor are these bills critical of the role of law enforcement in anti-Asian hate crimes. Our communities deserve better. Let us build a world where Black, Indigenous, and Communities of Color are safe and can thrive.

In response, Congresswoman Jahana Hayes proposed the “Access to Baby Formula Act” which has been signed into law by President Biden on May 21, 2022. The act gives families easier access to baby formula through Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) by lowering the requirements for eligibility during a time of crisis. In addition to this, Congresswoman Hayes and Senator Murphy traveled to a meeting with leaders of UConn Health and other members of the community to discuss further actions. Both the Congresswoman and the Senator are invested in avoiding another situation like this and want to insure that the consequences of this shortage are completely resolved. YWCA is deeply committed to insuring that everyone has access to health resources and is dedicated to assisting the under-served communities and how this situation has affected them specifically."

This shows how powerful social media is becoming in our democracies, and the role social media platforms have to consistently fact check those in power from creating a false narrative. Many organizers have fought and are still fighting for the truth. We will always stand with the Filipino community and we will take action. ➡️If you are a non-Filipino or could be more educated in Filipino history (dw that’s me too)— it’s time for us to educate ourselves on the Marcos Regime (because America isn’t the only country that exists!) ➡️ FOR NON FILIPINOS- John Oliver talked about the Philippines in a monologue 2 days ago, you can find it on youtube. ➡️ There is a FREE documentary on Vimeo called “The Kingmaker” which narrates & interviews the Marcos family. ➡️ There are activations, follow the accounts on the last page for resources."

This sends the wrong message to Kansas Girls who simply want to ensure fair competition. By Brad Cooper Gov. Laura Kelly on Thursday became the third governor to veto a bill banning or limiting transgender girls and women from participating in interscholastic sports for females. “This legislation sends a devastating message that Kansas is not welcoming to all children and their families, including those who are transgender – who are already at a higher risk of bullying, discrimination, and suicide,” Kelly said in a statement. As Kansans, we should be focused on how to include all students in extracurricular activities rather than how to exclude those who may be different than us. Kansas is an inclusive state and our laws should reflect our values. This law does not do that.” The veto had been widely anticipated since the governor had been signaling for days that she was opposed to the bill without outright saying she would veto the legislation. Kelly has always been a staunch advocate of the LGBTQ community. She took legal steps in 2019 to reverse a policy adopted under  former Gov. Sam Brownback’s administration to  allow transgender people to change their birth certificates consistent with their gender identity. The Legislature passed the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act short of having the two-thirds majority needed to override the governor’s veto. The House voted 76-43 for the bill with six lawmakers absent and not voting. It passed 26-11 in the Senate with three present and not voting. Senate President Ty Masterson told KCMO’s Pete Mundo last week that he thought he could get to the 27 votes needed to override the veto. He told Mundo that Kelly had no choice but to veto the bill. “Her party has gone so far that direction, they wouldn’t stand for it if she didn’t,” he said. But Masterson said he didn’t think the politics are in the governor’s favor. “She has a little trouble there because in general population that’s a 90% issue with us on fairness,” he said. Masterson promised a veto override. “There are a few (senators) on the margins,” he said. “We’ll see what they do when the pressure comes.”"

March 16. Every year, for almost 2,500 years since the time of Queen Esther, the Jewish people have celebrated the deliverance of the Jews of ancient Persia from intended annihilation. Since the ancient Persian Empire included most of the known world, including the land of Israel, this means that the Jewish population throughout the known world would have been destroyed. Because of this, the celebration of Purim is also significant for Christians! If the enemies of the Jews had been successful in annihilating the Jews of ancient Persia, there literally would have been no survivors who would become the ancestors of Jesus, born approximately 450 years after the time of Esther. In other words, if the Jews of Persia had been annihilated, there would have been no Jewish Jesus and therefore, no Christian faith rooted in the Jewish faith. This is one reason, among many, for Christians to appreciate the Jewish holiday of Purim and to stand with Jews everywhere in the ongoing battle against antisemitism and the delegitimization of the State of Israel."

Determined to break through the limits of her conservative upbringing, Jenny Phan began her involvement in the labor movement working at a unionized Catalyst dispensary. Although she loved her job, union, and coworkers, she realized there wasn't a lot of representation for people that looked like her. Wanting to further actualize the union message of strength and solidarity, Jenny stepped out of her comfort zone and advocated for her fellow coworkers by becoming the shop steward for her store. She eventually became a Special Project Union Representative for her union where she continues to play an instrumental role in setting the standard for the cannabis industry and cannabis workers. “This month I want to celebrate my AAPI family in the labor movement. Through my involvement in my union and the cannabis industry, I am reworking the narrative of what it means to be a working Asian person in America. I can be a strong outspoken Asian woman advocating for cannabis workers and workers overall while simultaneously being an example in the workplace with a relentless work ethic. To my AAPI family, I see you. Your labor matters regardless of what profession you’ve chosen. You are the community, and your voice is needed to achieve the working conditions necessary for all of us to thrive and succeed.”"

Juneteenth is a reminder that freedom in America is imperfect because of racism. For the indigenous First Nations, for Black people, and for immigrants throughout this country’s history, the justice of liberty and emancipation was delayed and denied. But Juneteenth is also a reminder that hope endures for a future where we can all be free. Implementing the RJA law and passing the Racial Justice Act for All - AB 256 (Kalra) - moves us closer to that future. The RJA is changing the culture of the courts for the better. Racist discrimination is never harmless when it happens in the courtroom. The Racial Justice Act is shining a light on how widespread racism is in California courts. With AB 256 (Kalra) - the Racial Justice Act for All - the Legislature has the opportunity to apply the RJA’s protections equally to all people, not just those that went to court after 2020. This year, we must pass the #RJA4All to #ConfrontRacism not only in the future, but for Black & Brown people languishing in jails & prisons right now. It takes all of us working together to bend the arc of history towards liberty for everyone.
