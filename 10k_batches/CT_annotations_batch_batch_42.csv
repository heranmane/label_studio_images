In addition, maternal mental health issues among Black women are largely underreported, and symptoms often go unaddressed. Lack of universal mental health education and screening, particularly during pregnancy, creates missed opportunities to provide clinical resources and counsel patients on symptoms and management of their depression, anxiety, or other mental health disorders. In addition, limited community resources and structured-referral provider networks lead to higher rates of inpatient hospital-based care, as opposed to care in community-based settings, for Black birthing populations.""

Since her first vintage in 2005, Coleman has been able to build a sense of calm confidence in her abilities. Victoria Coleman started her career working the vineyards on the rocky slopes of Atlas Peak, where grapes for the finest Napa wines are grown. But 17 years ago, her mentor, Mario Bazan, asked the UC Davis viticulture student if she wanted to try her hand at actually making wine. That’s how Victoria became the first Black woman winemaker in Napa. Her first vintage in 2005 was spectacular. She now supervises winemaking at a joint production facility called the Caves at Soda Canyon. And she is the exclusive red wines maker for Lobo Wines. But owner Randy Wulff says he didn’t hire her to strike a blow for social justice. Victoria earned her reputation through talent and hard work, but as the only African American in her UC Davis winemaking class, she understood what it would mean to become the first female Black winemaker in Napa Valley. Just like all winemakers, Victoria has to prove herself with each new season, each new vintage. But she said it feels good to know that she may have opened the door for others–who look like her–to walk through. Source: cbslocal -- #blackgirlnews"

Griffin, who also works as a personal chef, explained that she’s been obsessed with wine ever since she could remember. The NASA contractor honed in on her winemaking skills and knowledge in Cornell’s Wine Essentials course taught by Cheryl Stanley. After completing the program, Griffin launched her company, Anissa Wakefield Wines in 2019, becoming the first certified black woman winemaker in Alabama. The bustling entrepreneur earned her certification credentials in wines hailing from California, the Pacific Northwest, and New York in early 2020. Since then, Griffin has extended her passion for all things “vino” into a local club called the Black Cuvee for other wine aficionados living in Alabama. Griffin travels back and forth to Napa Valley, California regularly to check on the progress of her first vintage, which is a wine that is created from grapes that are all, or primarily, grown and harvested in a single specified year. Griffin also noted how the wine world hasn’t always been inclusive of Black women. Ultimately, the star said she is determined to get her wine on some airlines to expand the brand beyond Alabama.

About 8 countries compromise this territory, with about a dozen languages (not counting the many more dialects), and 7 or 8 religions. Just think about that diversity 🤯 --- We're very proud to represent a very tiny part of that diversity with Spice Waala 👳🏽‍♂️ but are very cognizant that it is not representative of the whole of Delhi nor Calcutta, nor the North of India, let alone the whole of India. South Asia has vast terrain and is ancient; various regions have been colonized several times in their history. So the people and their food are vastly different and deserve their own place to showcase their uniqueness. --- With Spice Waala we try to showcase our childhood and our favorite foods. Our menu showcases two types of street food and the endless specials we do try to showcase a little more diversity from across the country mainly staying in the Northern part (because we are very cognizant that we don't want to appropriate even one other region of India without understanding it properly). But we hope to showcase more and keep educating people about the richness of Indian 🇮🇳 cuisine so that over time people can come to appreciate the cuisine for more than the fake ""Chicken Tikka Masala"" it is currently known for. --- This journey starts with us but is propelled by you.

Black and vulnerable communities have been ‘disappeared’ into California’s prisons for far too long. The price of this social abandonment is of course incalculable.

Link in bio! @cagovernor @gavinnewsom has designated 2 prisons for closure, but there is NO indication closing prisons are part of his 2022-23 priorities. We are calling on him to continue this vital work and close at LEAST 8 more prisons by 2025. This would be a TRULY bold step toward accountability in the interest of racial justice and public health. Support BOLD solutions to systemic racism in our state, like prison closures, dramatic sentencing reforms, mass releases and shifting billions AWAY from law enforcement.  Achieving this vision should be one of the biggest moral and ethical imperatives of our time. #CareNotCages #ShutThemDown #FreeThemAll"
