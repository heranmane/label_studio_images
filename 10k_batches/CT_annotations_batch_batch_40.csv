Hearing the play aloud for, in essence, the first time. The memories of much of my life flooded in. It reminded me of all of the many concessions I, as a Black man, was expected to make, had to make, while dealing in a white-run world. The racial bias, the jokes, the being the “1” in the room, the “1” in the cast. I can only speak for working in this business. While I was working my way up in the theater, I was most likely the only “1”. If not the “1”, I was 1/2 of the Black couple. Off to the side or in the back—or once in a while featured for a moment in the front because I was Black.

While progress has been made and new HIV diagnoses among Black Americans fell 7% between 2014 to 2018, Black Americans still accounted for nearly half (42%) of all new HIV diagnoses in 2018 and the highest rate of new diagnoses than any other racial or ethnic group. Social and structural inequities experienced by the Black community may leave individuals at increased risk for HIV and make them less likely to receive the care they need. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has also disproportionately impacted communities of color, exacerbating the health disparities and inequities that continue to affect the Black community. *Rapid ART refers to starting HIV treatment as soon as possible after the diagnosis of HIV infection.

This 2-day training is an introduction to Somatic Experiencing and gives an overview of the clinical training. Participants will be able to learn about the SE framework and skills within the environment of a BIPOC-only group and explore how the skills are applicable to themselves and their communities. To further provide for a sense of safety during the workshop we ask that participants agree to the following: • I confirm that I identify as Black/African American, Indigenous or a Person of Color • This program introduces a framework for working with trauma, therefore it is possible that I may be triggered or become uncomfortable during the training. I confirm that my mental health is such that I will be able to recognize my own discomfort and reach out for support if necessary • I agree to allow other registered participants the right to speak for themselves. As such I will refrain from assuming that someone else needs me to defend or speak for them in this training and will instead attend to my own experience. When registering you will be prompted to choose one of the fees listed below. Please choose whichever option works best for you.
