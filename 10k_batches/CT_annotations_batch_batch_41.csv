Being a refugee herself, she knows all too well what these newly arrived families have endured and the obstacles that they may face being in a completely new environment. Manizha leads with compassion and wants to empower refugees, particularly the women and children, by example. She began volunteering with IROC as a result of her deep desire to support and empower those in need. Manizha is a mother of four beautiful children and her husband served in the US Army Special Forces. Manizha earned her Associates in Science from Farmingdale State College, NY. She is also a successful franchisee and most recently accepted a position as a Family Service Manager at Homes Not Borders.

We welcome presentations on an array of issues related to integrative wellness, collaborative delivery models, recruitment and retention, training issues in medical settings, interdisciplinary collaboration and treatments, the intersection of psychology and medical comorbidities, holistic and alternative healing methods, and implementation of new policies and infrastructure that support psychological integration in healthcare settings. We strongly encourage the submission of proposals that highlight the AfroLatinx perspective and address health disparities across underrepresented groups within the Latinx community. Presentation formats requested this year include symposia, workshops, poster sessions, and round table discussion groups. We extend this special invitation to the interdisciplinary community which includes but is not limited to mental health professionals, people with lived experiences, physicians, educators, holistic healers, administrators, and community stakeholders."

Please donate today! 3 DAYS LEFT TO HAVE YOUR DONATION MATCHED DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR! Dear Friends, As the days turn into weeks with the Russian invasion we salute the heroic and tireless efforts of the valiant professionals at The Jewish Agency for Israel, JDC, and World ORT and other organizations who are acting as the long arm of our Federations delivering critical assistance to the Jewish community in its hour of need. JFNA's first Fly-In to the Polish-Ukrainian border just wrapped up; it was an unforgettable experience for the first thirty Federation leaders who participated this week. After flying to Warsaw and being briefed by Polish Jewish leaders, we witnessed thousands of refugees crossing into Poland and being taken care of by our partners, the Jewish Agency and JDC, as well as by the many other relief agencies from around the world that have converged in eastern Poland. You can view brief clips of participants reflecting about the trip here. Another Fly-In is set for next week, and two additional ones are planned for early April. For the latest information on the emergency response activities of JDC and the Jewish Agency read today‚Äôs Ukraine Crisis update. It is also being widely reported today that Prime Minister Bennett has been the ‚Äúprimary international negotiator‚Äù in the ongoing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. For more, see today‚Äôs Times of Israel article. We pray that these efforts bear fruit in the very near future. In an inspiring show of generosity our Federations intensive fundraising efforts to meet the immediate needs of the crisis continue; Federations have collectively raised more than $27 million since the crisis began three weeks ago. Thank you for all that you are doing and please keep the momentum going! The Mid-Kansas Jewish Federation will match every dollar raised from our community, including dollars that have already been donated by YOU. Donations to be matched will need to arrive in our office by Monday, March 21, 2022. 3 DAYS LEFT TO MATCH YOUR DONATION!
