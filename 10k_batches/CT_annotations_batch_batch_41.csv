No one could write on the experience of Black American life quite like her, and no one has since. Through her work at Random House publishing, she was also able to edit works and support other incredible Black writers such as Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones, and Angela Davis. Toni Morrison not only dedicated her work to sharing #BlackStories, but her dedication to making space for other Black women and authors to write about our history through the lenses of magical realism and historical fiction was unprecedented.

Being a refugee herself, she knows all too well what these newly arrived families have endured and the obstacles that they may face being in a completely new environment. Manizha leads with compassion and wants to empower refugees, particularly the women and children, by example. She began volunteering with IROC as a result of her deep desire to support and empower those in need. Manizha is a mother of four beautiful children and her husband served in the US Army Special Forces. Manizha earned her Associates in Science from Farmingdale State College, NY. She is also a successful franchisee and most recently accepted a position as a Family Service Manager at Homes Not Borders. Listen to this uplifting Truman Charities episode with Manizha Azizi about her selfless help to aid refugees through Homes Not Borders. Here is what to expect on this week’s show: - Some of the challenges Manizha faced as a refugee. - The current crisis that is going on in Afghanistan. - The tools her organization is providing these refugee families and how they will help them succeed. - The values of Homes Not Borders.

Our Conferencia's theme aims to showcase new research, clinical practices, and applied models that examine how integrative relationships in healthcare are essential to building community wellness. We welcome presentations on an array of issues related to integrative wellness, collaborative delivery models, recruitment and retention, training issues in medical settings, interdisciplinary collaboration and treatments, the intersection of psychology and medical comorbidities, holistic and alternative healing methods, and implementation of new policies and infrastructure that support psychological integration in healthcare settings. We strongly encourage the submission of proposals that highlight the AfroLatinx perspective and address health disparities across underrepresented groups within the Latinx community. Presentation formats requested this year include symposia, workshops, poster sessions, and round table discussion groups. We extend this special invitation to the interdisciplinary community which includes but is not limited to mental health professionals, people with lived experiences, physicians, educators, holistic healers, administrators, and community stakeholders."

Please donate today! 3 DAYS LEFT TO HAVE YOUR DONATION MATCHED DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR! Dear Friends, As the days turn into weeks with the Russian invasion we salute the heroic and tireless efforts of the valiant professionals at The Jewish Agency for Israel, JDC, and World ORT and other organizations who are acting as the long arm of our Federations delivering critical assistance to the Jewish community in its hour of need. JFNA's first Fly-In to the Polish-Ukrainian border just wrapped up; it was an unforgettable experience for the first thirty Federation leaders who participated this week. After flying to Warsaw and being briefed by Polish Jewish leaders, we witnessed thousands of refugees crossing into Poland and being taken care of by our partners, the Jewish Agency and JDC, as well as by the many other relief agencies from around the world that have converged in eastern Poland. You can view brief clips of participants reflecting about the trip here. Another Fly-In is set for next week, and two additional ones are planned for early April. For the latest information on the emergency response activities of JDC and the Jewish Agency read today’s Ukraine Crisis update. It is also being widely reported today that Prime Minister Bennett has been the “primary international negotiator” in the ongoing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. For more, see today’s Times of Israel article. We pray that these efforts bear fruit in the very near future. In an inspiring show of generosity our Federations intensive fundraising efforts to meet the immediate needs of the crisis continue; Federations have collectively raised more than $27 million since the crisis began three weeks ago. Thank you for all that you are doing and please keep the momentum going! The Mid-Kansas Jewish Federation will match every dollar raised from our community, including dollars that have already been donated by YOU. Donations to be matched will need to arrive in our office by Monday, March 21, 2022. 3 DAYS LEFT TO MATCH YOUR DONATION! JFNA has appointed a Ukraine Allocations Subcommittee of the Israel and Overseas Committee to allocate funds and get money moving to the field now. David Brown from Chicago, former Chair of the I&O Committee and incoming Vice Chair of JFNA, will lead this work. The Subcommittee will meet later today and we will update you tomorrow on the first round of approved allocations. An emergency campaign is underway–click here to make your donation, mail or drop off a check to the MKJF at 1850 N. Woodlawn, Wichita, Kansas 67208. Please note that is is for the UKRAINE. Our partners will utilize this support in a variety of ways, including: · Maintaining critical welfare services · Emergency aliyah and community security · Temporary housing for those in transit · Stockpiling goods · Satellite phones to ensure communication · Ensuring staff at Jewish school are safe and prepared to respond · Medical staff supports With your support, we are ready to help. We also will closely follow all developments and will update you with any pertinent information. Our office has reached out to some in the community to check if they know anyone that needs assistance. If you know of someone in need, please contact our office. We are all part of Kehilat Yisrael. Whenever and wherever one Jew is threatened, we are all responsible to come to their aid. While we pray for peace, we also work to help all those in danger.
