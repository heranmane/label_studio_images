Simu Liu desperately wanted to get ‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù before becoming a MCU superhero. The ‚ÄúKim‚Äôs Convenience‚Äù breakout star revealed that he auditioned four times for Jon M. Chu‚Äôs ‚ÄúCrazy Rich Asians‚Äù and ultimately lost out on the role. Why? Well, because Liu apparently didn‚Äôt have the ‚ÄúIt‚Äù factor for Hollywood. ‚ÄúThrough some sort of broken telephone, whether it had gone through a studio exec or a casting director before it got to our side, we got, ‚ÄòWell Simu doesn‚Äôt have the X-factor.

I didn‚Äôt have that thing that made people want to watch it. It was at a time that was very difficult for me, I was trying to figure out whether I could be the lead character or whether I could only be a supporting character for my entire career.‚Äù The whole experience led to Liu reflecting on his approach to auditions, with the star saying, ‚ÄúIt forced me to take a step back and realize that maybe I wanted it too badly. Like maybe I was too desperate and that desperation was showing in my work. There had to be an element of confidence in what I was doing and self-assuredness. I had to trust I was talented and I was watchable and I was good.‚Äù Read more on IndieWire"
