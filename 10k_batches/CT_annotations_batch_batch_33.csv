A chance viewing from a NY theater critic of the pair's urban youth acting program became the spark they needed to make their dream a reality. The duo joined forces with theater manager Gerald S. Krone and got to work. They soon found a home at the St. Marks Playhouse in New York, and with the help of a donation from the Ford Foundation, the Negro Ensemble Company was officially born in 1967. Despite numerous ups and downs and financial issues, NEC has solidified its place as one of the most influential Black theater companies of all time. They have produced over 200 plays, won numerous awards from Tonys to the Pulitzer Prize, and have given a platform to some of the greatest Black voices of all time including, Debbie Allen, Hinton, Battle, Angela Bassett, Laurence Fishburne, Danny Glover, Samuel L. Jackson, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Denzel Washington, and countless others. üì∑: From left, Adolph Caesar, Denzel Washington and Peter Friedman in the 1981 Negro Ensemble Company production of ‚ÄúA Soldier‚Äôs Play (Credit: Bert Andrews)"

Misspotogold is a 2017 mare who stands at approximately 16 hands (and growing a bit). This mare is a wonderful horse to be around and work with. This horse is quiet, mannerly, a decent keeper, barefoot, has no vices and will stand tied or cross tied. Misspotogold tacks up easily, has started learning how to lunge, likes working on the ground and is attentive to her handlers and rider. This mare stood quietly to be tacked up as well as at the mounting block. PERFECT HOME - Adult ammy who is seeking loving mare friend who wants to please, trail ride and conquer some pleasure riding with some weekend outings here and there. The video link below (warning, about 8 minutes long) shows how we really take our time with our horses to offer enough time to comfortably and confidently start back under saddle. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELCz6WQnug Many of you see horses in our program for MONTHS- or even a year or so. There's a reason for that- this video is proof enough. After passing her leading, grooming and crosstie assessments, Misspotogold tacked easily and gave a lovely walk, trot and canter on a loose rein. We feel that a rubber mullen mouth (non jointed rubber coated) would be her perfect bit as she does not pull. Her rider described her as a soft ride requiring lots of leg. Her rider also noted that she was very kind and willing to move off leg. You will see mid-video how we teach obstacles and desensitize the horses in our program. As Misspotogold rehabiliated an injury successfully, she was offered AMPLE downtime after exiting rehabilitation free in the herd to graze and relax. Missppotogold crossed logs, cantered with the flag and navigated ground poles and a small jump. She then was able to work in the arena and then headed out on the trail by herself (again, her FIRST ride off the track) and walked around the trails quietly alone. This was this horse's first ride (today). We feel she would be an EXCELLENT trail/pleasure horse for someone. Serious adopters only. Application required. www.OTTBS.org:=:https://www.ottbs.org/ for more information and adoption fee."

What would the news coming out of Afghanistan look like? MUSA QALA - A Taliban detachment of videographers assigned to film an attack on US forces accidentally identified a weakness in their force: Taliban are poor judges of cover vs. concealment. The revelation came to Taliban leadership after reviewing the footage and seeing their fighters taking cover behind empty, plastic 55gal drums, hay piles, and other objects that only protect against sight and sound, but not small arms fire. ""Many of these men have only fought in mountains,"" said Abdul Yasir, Commander of Taliban forces in the Helmand Province. ""There it is all-mountain, and tree, and rock. Very good covers. Less to think about."" According to Yasir, the problem begins when his men come down from the mountains to fight in villages and have to choose between man-made options for cover. ""Is not really a problem,"" Yasir continued, ""I don't actually expect my men to win fights. Real win comes from chipping away at America's resolve until they pack up and leave.

Kevin Richardson, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Duke, will be giving a talk entitled ‚ÄúAre Black Men a Counterexample to Feminism?‚Äù Professor Richardson‚Äôs research focuses on two broad questions: How are social kinds (like gender and race) constructed by social groups? And how do linguistic practices (like assertions about racial identity) shape social reality? In this talk, he will draw on the thesis of Tommy Curry‚Äôs book The Man-Not, which claims that Black men are oppressed in virtue of being men, and examine how it contradicts ‚Äúclassic feminist theory, which holds that no man, of any race, can be oppressed in virtue of being a man.‚Äù Disagreeing with Curry‚Äôs view that Black men are oppressed on the basis of their gender, Prof. Richardson argues that we can better understand the plight of Black men if we have a more sophisticated framework for analyzing oppression.

Founded in 1877, in Tanner, Alabama, George Bridgeforth, Sr., a former slave, began purchasing land after the civil war, his ambition was to start a family & grow his farm. Today, it's a 4th & 5th generation black-owned family farm that expands over 10,000 acres, producing cotton, corn, soybeans, & wheat, along with a 5,000-acre fruit orchard. ""legacy, entrepreneurship, pride, success, & strength."" is what the cotton from these lands represent to her & her family, says Jelita.
