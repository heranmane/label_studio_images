In 2020, the series revealed how a complex web of policies, created by the United States under the Trump presidency and supported by Mexico's own government, had created a virtually impenetrable policy wall for asylum seekers. This time, the series explores changes ‚Äîor the lack of‚Äî after the first year of the Biden administration, and their effect on migrants who have spent months, sometimes years, trying to make it through Mexico into the U.S. Finding that the demographic of asylum seekers arriving in Mexico has changed, the report shifts even further south, traveling to the Dari√©n Gap, the jungle at the border between Colombia and Panama, where hundreds of people arrive daily, risking their lives in hopes of making it one step closer to the U.S. LISTEN HERE: bit.ly/lusaborder3:=:https://www.latinousa.org/2022/03/11/themovingborderpartthree/"

With this year‚Äôs nominations, the Academy Awards are shining a spotlight on some Latino artists, with hit films like ""Encanto"" and ""West Side Story"" in the running for some of the evening‚Äôs biggest prizes‚Äîand to possibly even make some history. But many critics find it worth asking: is this the kind of representation Latinos and Latinas have been looking for in Hollywood? And after being systematically shut out of the Oscars for nearly a century, is this recognition from the Academy something we should be striving for, anyway? On this episode of Latino USA, Latino and Latina film critics Clayton Davis, Cristina Escobar, and Jack Rico step up to the mic for a roundtable about Latinos in film this past year. Ahead of Hollywood‚Äôs biggest night, they discuss the honors (and snubs) for Latino-led films this awards season. They also talk about the importance of diversity in criticism and push the conversation past the topic of ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù to envision a more inclusive future for Latinos in Hollywood and the film industry as a whole.

They were never seen again. Their disappearance sparked mass protests, as the 43 became symbols of Mexico‚Äôs unchecked human rights abuses.

LISTEN HERE: https://bit.ly/tangoresiste:=:https://www.latinousa.org/2022/01/07/tangoresiste/ While tango is usually pictured as a dance between a white man in an elegant black suit and a white woman in high heels and a tight red dress, the reality of tango goes much deeper. Born in the brothels and dance halls of Buenos Aires‚Äô lower caste, this music and dance are actually rooted in Argentina‚Äôs African and queer subcultures. Before it became the defining music of Argentina, tango was actually condemned by elites, and the Catholic church, which saw it as obscene and transgressive. The dance‚Äôs reign was also threatened by the worldwide phenomenon of rock n‚Äô roll and then all but buried by Argentina's Dirty War. When tango began its revival in the 1980s and 90s, a new era of tango artists began challenging rigid norms established in the early half of the 20th century. Breaking from traditional gender roles and shining a light on the Black history of tango, these artists aimed to invoke tango‚Äôs past to make way for a more inclusive future. In this episode, we‚Äôll travel to Argentina and meet three women who will help us to understand the controversial roots of tango and how they are helping to give new life to a dance very much rooted in tradition.

Arroyo Arts Collective Artists and the Rock Rose Gallery Youth Art Interns explore the themes of climate change, heat, drought, and wildfire, using repurposed umbrellas their canvas. The proposed outdoor installation will address and highlight the issue of shade equity, a problem that disproportionately affects low-income and working-class communities and people of color, who are more likely to work outdoors, rely on public transportation, and live in neighborhoods with a lack of trees and shade. As the climate changes and the planet warms, what was once thought primarily as an aesthetic amenity is increasingly recognized as a way of protecting the public health and wellbeing of marginalized communities. Shade in L.A. is made possible through the generous support of the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors through the Los Angeles County Arts Commission and by the California Arts Council, a state agency.

Through the ‚ÄúNational Advocacy‚Äù pillar of empowerment, NaFFAA calls for a more inclusive Filipino-American community and be an example of showing love and intolerance against all forms of hate crimes toward the LGBTQI+ community. Recent studies show that 40% of AAPI LGBTQI+ youths have considered suicide in the last year. A survey from the Trevor Project found that 40 percent of LGBTQI+ youths who are Asian American or Pacific Islander, or AAPI, have seriously considered suicide in the past year. Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian youths experienced the highest rate, at 49 percent, followed by Korean American youths, at 47 percent, and Filipino American youths, at 41 percent. For many Filipino Americans, coming out is a lifelong process that can require a different approach because of cultural norms or traditions that emphasize duty to family and community. ‚ÄúWe celebrate each member of our Filipino community. We are proud of the unique talents, perspectives, and offerings each of you provides to make our 4 million strong Filipino community stronger than ever,‚Äù said NaFFAA President and Chairman Brendan Flores. ‚ÄúDiversity includes differences in sexual orientation, religion, political parties, and other groups you affiliate yourself into. We hope that instead of focusing on these differences, we will take time to focus on our biggest similarity - being Filipino-Americans.‚Äù Diverse Segments Director Gio Duaqui says: ‚ÄúApproximately 4.2 million Filipino Americans are working tirelessly to achieve the American Dream and to improve their communities. Imagine how much more we can accomplish and amplify our efforts as a unified voice by building bridges to other segments of our diverse population. I am proud to see NAFFAA is moving in that direction to ensure everyone is welcome and included. After all, the American Dream belongs to all of us. Happy Pride Month!‚Äù NaFFAA does not tolerate any forms of prejudice against any of our ‚Äúkapatid‚Äù in the LGBTQI+ community. We celebrate their successes and recognize the great and important contributions they make to make us a better and stronger country. Our leaders look forward to continuing to support our ‚Äúkapatid‚Äù in the LGBTQI+ community. See full press release here: https://naffaa.org/naffaa-celebrates-fil-am-leaders-in-the-lgbtq-community-for-junes-pride-month-celebration/ ‚Äî- Since 1997, the National Federation of Filipino American Associations (NaFFAA) has been the standard-bearer for promoting the welfare and well-being of the four million Filipinos and Filipino Americans throughout the United States. NaFFAA is the largest non-partisan, non-profit organization and national affiliation of Filipino American institutions, umbrella organizations, and individuals. Its fourteen-member regions cover the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and the Pacific Islands."
