This too applies to those that identify as BIPOC. There are some privileges that you are born into and others that you “earn” by obtaining symbols of power (money, positions, education, etc.).  As you go about your day, you may be hypervigilant to when you are experiencing oppression. Sometimes you are subjected to it all day. Despite my marginalized racial identity, looking through an intersectionality lens has also drawn attention to the privilege that I have. For Black, Indigenous, and People of Color recognizing privilege can be difficult to take in. This intersectionality wheel created by @sylviaduckworth, though, is a reminder that (1) our privileged and oppressed identities can change depending on where we are and who we’re with and (2) we have a duty to be co-conspirators with our fellow BIPOC people who are disabled, houseless, non-binary, identify as LGBTQ+, or experience from mental illness (and more). To reflect on your intersecting identities, check out Week 2 of the BIPOC Activist Workbook at bit.ly/BIPOCActivistWkbk:=:https://sites.google.com/view/antiracismeveryday/bipoc-activist-workbook or in our bio. -Monai Alt text available. #intersectionality #kimberlecrenshaw #lgbtqrights #disabilityrights #immigrantsmakeamericagreat #ningunserhumanoesilegal"

Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."" 13 The Pharisees challenged him, ""Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."" 14 Jesus answered, ""Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. 15 You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. 16 But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. 17 In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid. 18 I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."" 19 Then they asked him, ""Where is your father?"" ""You do not know me or my Father,"" Jesus replied. ""If you knew me, you would know my Father also."" 20 He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come. 21 Once more Jesus said to them, ""I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."" 22 This made the Jews ask, ""Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?"" 23 But he continued, ""You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. 24 I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins."" 25 ""Who are you?"" they asked. ""Just what I have been claiming all along,"" Jesus replied. 26 ""I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."" 27 They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. 28 So Jesus said, ""When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. 29 The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him."" 30 Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him."

The fire-spitting duo recently dropped a new jam titled ‘Awake’, which is the title track for their new Extended Play (EP). There’s no denying that ‘Awake’ is a project that will instantly make you a stern believer of Baby Radar and Hell Rell’s musical works. Thanks to their impressive rapping skills that cannot be overlooked even for a second, Baby Radar and Hell Rell managed to pull it off in ‘Awake’, just like they have done in their several other songs. Their EP ‘Awake’ is an intimate masterpiece that features 7 tracks which include; ‘Synagogue’, ‘90s Love’ ft Lyricc Monique, ‘Brecken’, ‘Man In The Mirror’, ‘R & B Love’ ft Nerdboi Mar, ‘Awake’ and ‘Summer Days.’ The EP is a tale soul-bearing lyricism touching on deep serious issues and subjects like overcoming hardships, beating the ghetto struggles, the pain, the rise, the sacrifices they had to make and the prices they had to pay for the success they enjoy today."

Years in the making, the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act is among some 200 bills that have been introduced over the past century that have tried to ban lynching in America. It is named for the Black teenager whose brutal killing in Mississippi in 1955 — and his mother’s insistence on a open funeral casket to show the world what had been done to her child — became a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights era. “After more than 200 failed attempts to outlaw lynching, Congress is finally succeeding in taking a long overdue action by passing the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The bill would make it possible to prosecute a crime as a lynching when a conspiracy to commit a hate crime results in death or serious bodily injury, according to the bill's champion, Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. The maximum sentence under the Anti-Lynching Act is 30 years. Last week, the House overwhelmingly approved a revised version and the Senate passed the bill unanimously late Monday. ""Lynching is a longstanding and uniquely American weapon of racial terror that has for decades been used to maintain the white hierarchy,” said Rush. The congressman said passage of the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act “sends a clear and emphatic message that our nation will no longer ignore this shameful chapter of our history and that the full force of the U.S. federal government will always be brought to bear against those who commit this heinous act.”"

In many places, January 1 is “day one” of the new year, based on a calendar that follows the Earth’s movement around the sun. But the lunar calendar—upon which the Chinese New Year is based—tracks time by the moon cycles. That’s why people all over the world celebrate Chinese New Year on different days each year; this year the calendar starts on February 1. According to the Chinese calendar, the year you were born might determine your personality. That’s because each year is represented by an animal, called a Chinese zodiac sign, and legend has it that people born under that sign have similar traits to the animal. (The year 2022—starting February 1—is the Year of the Tiger.)"

Following the success of the rally, Fedor launched AAPI Youth Rising, a collective of middle school activists who are devoted to uplifting their community and stopping racist hate. In the fall of 2021, they joined other student-led coalitions in demonstrations of support for AB 101, an education bill that would require every public high school student in California to take an ethnic studies course. “Asian American history is American history, and everyone’s history deserves to be taught and represented,” Fedor says. “Histories that negatively reflect America tend to not be taught as much and that’s very wrong, because we don’t learn about our previous errors.” She thinks that if more people were aware of the long history of anti-Asian violence in America, there might not have been the current surge in racist incidents towards the AAPI community.

""Genital mutilation,"" Paul bellowed as he started questioning the first transgender person nominated to a Senate-confirmed position, Dr. Rachel Levine.” https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/02/rand-paul-goes-unhinged-transphobic-rant-dr-rachel-levines-confirmation-hearing/ “Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) went on an anti-transgender tirade when questioning Dr. Rachel Levine, President Joe Biden’s nominee for assistant secretary of health. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a joint hearing to confirm Surgeon General Nominee Dr. Vivek Murphy and Dr. Levine, who is transgender and is the current surgeon general for Pennsylvania. Most questions focused on the government’s response to COVID-19. But Sen. Paul decided to rant about how gender affirming health care for transgender kids should be banned instead of left up to families and doctors. Genital mutilation has been nearly universally condemned,” Paul started, literally comparing gender affirming health care to child genital mutilation directly to a transgender woman. “Genital mutilation has been condemned by the WHO, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund.” He went on to say that genital mutilation is egregious because “it is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children.” If he wanted to compare bottom surgery to genital mutilation, he was already starting out wrong – it’s almost unheard of for minors to get bottom surgery. In fact, that’s why everyone is talking about puberty blockers all the time – to give trans youth more time to understand themselves before puberty permanently affects their bodies. He then turned to puberty blockers and cited the American College of Pediatricians, an SPLC designated hate group that promotes anti-LGBTQ bias. It is often confused with the American Pediatric Association, the real professional association for pediatricians that urges parents of trans kids to “listen, respect and support their child’s self-expressed identity.” Paul says that “80 to 90 percent” of children with gender dysphoria “will experience resolution,” a euphemism for stopping being transgender. This statistic is fake but Paul said it anyway at a Senate hearing. “Dr. Levine, do you believe that minors are capable of making such a life-changing decision as changing one’s sex?” Paul asked Dr. Levine, who appeared shocked by the entire rant. “Transgender medicine is a very complex and nuanced field with robust research and standards of care that have been developed,” Levine responded, remaining respectful. “I will look forward to working with you and your office and coming to your office to discuss the particulars of the standards of care for transgender medicine.” But Paul shot back: “The specific question was about minors” and accused her evading the question “Do you support the government intervening to override the parents’ consent to give a child puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and/or amputation of breasts and genitalia?” he asked. He then said that he “would hope you would have compassion” for a person who took puberty blockers as a teen and then stopped. He then called transitioning a “temporary, superficial fix for a very complex identity issue.” Again, Dr. Levine said, “Transgender medicine is a very complex and nuanced field” and that she “will certainly be pleased” to talk about it with Sen. Paul if confirmed. “Let it go into the record that the witness refused to answer the question,” Paul said. “You give a woman testosterone enough that she grows a beard,” he said, not talking about puberty blockers at all anymore, “you think she’s going to go back to looking like a woman when she stops the testosterone?” He said that “dozens of people who have been through this regret that it has happened” and that there are “no long term studies” on the effects of puberty blockers, even though there are and the science shows that transgender teens who wanted puberty blockers and got them have a significantly lower risk of suicidal thoughts than those who didn’t get them. Immediately after Paul questioned her, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), asked Dr. Levine about LGBTQ health and addressing systemic health disparities. Most of the other senators asked Dr. Levine about the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”"

PrisonPolicy.org released a study in March of 2021, and the findings, while shocking, aren't necessarily surprising. Like this fact. LGBTQ+ youth are vastly overrepresentated in the American criminal justice system. Much of this stems from youth coming out and not being accepted by their families due to their sexuality or gender identification. When children are kicked out of their homes, many turn to the streets and the ""work"" they can do to get by: drug sales, theft, or survival sex. They get arrested and sent to juvenille facilities. And of course, as we've discussed time and again, once you've got a conviction on your record, you're caught in the relentless incarceration cycle. It's hard to break those chains. At Turning Leaf, we don't work with youth, but we DO work with people who started on the incarceration cycle when they were very young.

Eliot wrote. And the reality Cone relentlessly exposed was one most white Americans seek to deny. “Christianity is essentially a religion of liberation,” Cone writes. “The function of theology is that of analyzing the meaning of that liberation for the oppressed community so they can know that their struggle for political, social, and economic justice is consistent with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Any message that is not related to the liberation of the poor is not Christ’s message. Any theology that is indifferent to the theme of liberation is not Christian theology. In a society where [people] are oppressed because they are black, Christian theology must become Black Theology, a theology that is unreservedly identified with the goals of the oppressed community and seeking to interpret the divine character of their struggle for liberation.”"

After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in elementary education, he moved to Utah where he taught Kindergarten for over 25 years. During the pandemic he decided to get out of retirement and help with the teaching shortage by teaching half day kindergarten. One year he wrote a book called, “Little Samoan Boys Don’t Wear Miniskirts” based on his own personal experiences immigrating to a new country and what it was like to dress and look different and how kids can learn to appreciate cultural diversity. We laughed at this back then, but his first year of teaching a neighborhood lady called the cops on him during recess duty. I look back and didn’t quite realize until I was older what that must have been like for him to be brown and pursuing a field that is typically viewed as for females. I am so proud of my father and what he has been able to accomplish including enriching our education system with his unique experiences and talents. #ImmigrantHeritageMonth #CelebrateImmigrants Voices staff share from Laneta Fitisemanu, Communication Director"

Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which branded Japanese Americans as enemies of the state and enabled the forced removal and imprisonment of 120,000 Japanese Americans in camps across the United States. Join JMRL tomorrow, Monday, March 14 at 6:30pm, for the virtual talk ""Japanese American Incarceration In History and Memory"" with Joseph Wei. A doctoral candidate in Asian American studies at the University of Virginia, Wei will shed light on this key historical episode by covering the legal and historical context of Japanese Americans' unjust imprisonment, the lives they made while in the camps, and the aftermath of the incarceration. The program can be accessed both by Zoom online or a toll-free phone number. Sign up at jmrl.org/samepage:=:https://jmrl.org/samepage/ or call 434.973.7893 x4.

The B-25 will not be stopping at the Brookings Airport. Please SEE BELOW for a message from the organizers and help to spread the word. RAID ACROSS SOUTH DAKOTA WWII AIRCRAFT VISIT POSTPONED ""Planners of the Raid Across South Dakota B-25 cross country, multi-community flight event announced the event has been postponed until further notice. The event, slated from May 9-12, is postponed due to a crucial mechanical issue with the aircraft’s engine and an emphasis on safety. “This is heartbreaking news,” said event producer John Mollison. “The amount of community support, energy and enthusiasm behind RAID’22 has been extraordinary. Many thousands of people around the globe looked forward to our eight-stop journey. However, the safety of the crew and integrity of the aircraft over-ride all decisions. Based onthe facts at-hand, we cannot proceed as planned. The B-25 is owned and operated by the Minnesota Wing of the Commemorative Air Force (MN CAF). Named, “Miss Mitchell,” this B-25 is one of the most accurately restored examples of its kind. MN CAF representative Jim Lauria states, “These airplanes are strong and well maintained. But they are mechanical objects that are subject to the same forces that can wear and break anything. The CAFs relationship with South Dakota, RAID and the Airshow is like family — this makes it all the harder to realize we simply cannot make the necessary repairs in time. ”RAID’22 planners, including the CAF, are focusing on distributing this important news and fixing the aircraft. Mollison states,”RAID is a great idea and we’ll work to find a way to fulfill what we all looked for. In the meantime, we simply have to get the word out that this next week’s events have to be postponed. ”The RAID’22 event was intended to be a kick-off of the Ellsworth Air & Space Show May 14-15. RAID ‘stops’ were Sioux Falls, Brookings, Aberdeen, Chamberlain, Rosebud, Pierre and Rapid City. The Ellsworth airshow remains as scheduled and the public is advised that a B-25 Mitchell bomber to represent the Doolittle Raid will be present at the event. Future RAID planning as well as current information on the Ellsworth Air Force Base Airshow will be posted on webpage at www.ellsworthairshow.com:=:https://www.ellsworthairshow.com/ and on social media channels."
