Today we're proud to show off THE CHINESE GROOVE by Kathryn Ma Author, a funny, sweet novel of family and the immigrant experience. Our cover was designed by Na Kim, with Nicole Caputo Design as art director. The Chinese Groove will be on shelves January 24th 2023! About the book: Anne Tyler meets Jade Chang in this buoyant, good-hearted, and sharply written novel about a blithely optimistic immigrant with big dreams, dire prospects, and a fractured extended family in need of his help—even if they don't know it yet. Eighteen-year-old Shelley, born into a much-despised branch of the Zheng family in Yunnan Province and living in the shadow of his widowed father’s grief, dreams of bigger things. Buoyed by an exuberant heart and his cousin Deng’s tall tales about the United States, Shelley heads to San Francisco to claim his destiny, confident that any hurdles will be easily overcome by the awesome powers of the ""Chinese groove,"" a belief in the unspoken bonds between countrymen that transcend time and borders. Upon arrival, Shelley is dismayed to find that his ""rich uncle"" is in fact his unemployed second cousin once removed and that the grand guest room he’d envisioned is but a crappy sofa. The indefinite stay he’d planned for? That has a firm two-week expiration date. Even worse, the loving family he hoped would embrace him is in shambles, shattered by a senseless tragedy that has cleaved the family in two. They want nothing to do with this youthful bounder who’s barged into their lives. Ever the optimist, Shelley concocts a plan to resuscitate his American dream by insinuating himself into the family. And, who knows, maybe he’ll even manage to bring them back together in the process. Watch for it next winter!"

Her earliest performances ignited her career at the Springer Opera House, which also hosted Oscar Wilde and Buffalo Bill Cody. After her Opera House shows, Ma would go on to tour and perform with Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, and T-Bone Walker, and her legacy would touch on all art forms. Here are just a few ways she impacted the zeitgeist: - Performing in some of the first integrated shows in the American south, Ma's glamorous attire, which included sparkling tiaras and feather boas, initiated a major shift in costumery for performers of her genre. - She adapted a popular dance originating in New Orleans, named ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" which was later performed by stars Judy Garland and Ginger Rodgers. - Ma is referenced in Langston Hughes' ""The Blues"" and is reborn as the character Shug Avery in Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple."" Maybe most notably though, is that through her candid, unapologetic lyrics about her life, Ma Rainey became an icon for the LGBTQ+ community."
