Topics include Gwen sharing more about her protest in 2019, the backlash and what she learned from it, the power and importance of athlete voice in raising awareness of systemic racism and police violence and the importance of keeping the legacies of Eric, Sean and Atatiana alive all while navigating the pain of losing a loved one.

My experiences, observations, and/or studies have led me to believe the following: ‚Ä¢ Racism has done more to promote non-justice than any other socio-material system known to have been produced or supported by the people of the known universe. ‚Ä¢ No major problem that exists between the people of the known universe can be eliminated, until Racism is eliminated. ‚Ä¢ The fear, frustration, malice, and confusion caused by Racism, retards or prevents all constructive activity between the people of the known universe. ‚Ä¢ The only form of functional Racism that exists among the people of the known universe is ‚ÄúWhite Supremacy.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ The people who have the ability to eliminate Racism, do not have the will to do so, and the people who have the will to do so, do not have the ability. ‚Ä¢ Regardless of all that has been said or done, the quality of the relationship between white people and black people is, and has been, a total disaster. ‚Ä¢ Justice is better than Racism. ‚Ä¢ As long as Racism exists, anything said or done by people that is not intended to help eliminate Racism and to help produce justice, is a waste of time and energy. Each and every Victim of Racism should minimize the time and effort spent doing anything other than thinking, speaking, and acting in a manner that helps to eliminate Racism and helps to establish justice. Each and every person should seek to do this every day, in every area of activity, including Economics, Education, Entertainment, Labor, Law, Politics, Religion, Sex, and War/Counter-War."

Woodson, Ph.D. ‚ÄúThe Father of Black History‚Äù Order Today: https://www.amazon.com/Mis-Education-Negro-Carter-Godwin-Woodson/dp/1680920685 The Mis-Education of the Negro is a book originally published in 1933 by Dr. Carter G. Woodson. The thesis of Dr. Woodson's book is that blacks of his day were being culturally indoctrinated, rather than taught, in American schools. This conditioning, he claims, causes blacks to become dependent and to seek out inferior places in the greater society of which they are a part. He challenges his readers to become autodidacts and to ""do for themselves"", regardless of what they were taught: History shows that it does not matter who is in power... those who have not learned to do for themselves and have to depend solely on others never obtain any more rights or privileges in the end than they did in the beginning. Here is a quote from the book: ""When you control a man's thinking you do not have to worry about his actions. You do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder. He will find his 'proper place' and will stay in it. You do not need to send him to the back door. He will go without being told. In fact, if there is no back door, he will cut one for his special benefit. His education makes it necessary."""

When God laid out the divine plan, which is called the Divine Decrees, He partitioned up history into separate dispensations. Each dispensation having unique attributes of its own. The Garden was unique in that only Adam and Eve lived in the Garden of Eden. That was the first dispensation, or the Age of Innocence. That was followed by the next dispensation which spanned from their eviction out of the Garden, to the Flood of Noah. These are unique time frames with obvious beginnings and endings. The next dispensation followed the pattern of family rule from the post-flood days of Noah to Abraham. Job would be the best example of family rule. Then there was the Age of the Patriarchs, which separated the line of Christ making it unique from all other lines. Then there was the Age of Israel, which spanned from the Exodus which defined the nation and continued to the time of Jesus and the Cross. Old Testament prophecy states that the pattern and time of the sacrifice of the Messiah would be followed by the establishment of the Kingdom of God. But that did not happen immediately. Back then all of the Jewish people were looking for the Kingdom, but there was an interruption of the dispensation of the Age of Israel, which has seven more years remaining within it. This is Daniels seventieth week or last week, in his seventy weeks prophecy. Each week representing a year for each day of the week. In his seventy weeks prophecy, each day of the week represented one year (70*7=490). From the time of that prophecy, 483 years or sixty nine weeks of years (69*7=483) had passed, leaving one final week of years, or seven years. That final week of years or seven years, was or will be, the great tribulation in which most of the prophecies of the Old Testament are to take place. These years were to be the final years of the Age of Israel. After the Cross, which occurred at the Feast of Passover, then fifty days later at the Feast of Pentecost, our current dispensation, which we generally call the Church Age, began. We interrupted the Age of Israel which has seven years remaining within it. So, the Kingdom of God was postponed in order to insert into history, and complete, our current dispensation. Our current dispensation is generally called the Church Age, but it is also called the Age of the Bride of Christ, and is also called the Age of the Royal Family. All of these titles refer to the same dispensation. When our current dispensation ends, and it will end with the event of the Rapture, then the Age of Israel will resume in order to complete its last seven years. That is when all of these final days of history prophecies, will occur. So, in our verse, the phrase, 'in that day,' refers to the final days of history as they will occur within the Age of Israel. Remember that the Church Age was never mentioned in the Old Testament. Our dispensation was kept secret from history. Therefore all of the prophecies from the Old Testament refer to and are contained within, the Age of Israel and never to our Church Age. And so, these events from Isaiah's day, are types or examples of the events that will occur once again, in the Tribulation. The world will rise up against Israel to destroy it. Assyria, the region, to the north will rise against Israel and will destroy Israel, but then it, itself will be destroyed by God. The trend will repeat itself over and over again with Babylon, Persia, Greece and finally Rome. And then one last time, at the end of history. And here is the prophecy for specifically Jewish people. The remnant that has escaped of the house of Jacob, is a reference to specifically Jewish people. Other gentile believers will escape too, but this is one of many references wherein God promises that there will be a Jewish race in existence at the end of human history. Thus the obsession of Satan to destroy Israel and all Jewish people prior to those last days of history. During Isaiah's time, the nation was overrun such that most people were either killed or taken into captivity. There are other prophecies that promise a return of a remnant to the land. But here, the remnant will return to God. They will not stay, on their oppressive invaders, but will stay, on the Lord. To stay, 'shaan,' means to rely on, to depend on, to follow, to stay or remain with. And so this remnant will escape, 'paleytah,' is in the feminine form and means to be delivered, or to escape the hands of their enemies, being delivered or rescued by God. They do not rescue themselves. God is the masculine who rescues the feminine. We know that in the Tribulation many will run to the mountains (truncated)"

Her description of each character put me right in the middle of the story. I found myself not wanting to put the book down. Her factual information is very thorough and true. You can tell she has done a lot of research. I look forward to reading the books to follow. Thanks for such a great series! REVIEW: To sum it up, I'm spellbound by both. I've lost countless hours of sleep. Can't put the books down. Love the time period, characterizations, and the plot. REVIEW:If you liked Gone with the Wind you will love this. The story is much more personal about the time and events of the Civil War, it is not so much about the social lives as the events. It is, however, not a dry historical novel. There is a wonderful narrative of what is happening. Each book in the series covers the events of one year. I am already on the second book.

With believable characters and rich descriptions, author Ginny Dye takes the reader into a world when life was not easy and and where personal choices seem more profound . Falling in love with the main character, Carrie, is easy because the author does a wonderful job of taking the reader inside of her maturing thoughts and internal conflicts. I can hardly wait to read the next novel in the series ! REVIEW: Ginny Dye takes very ordinary people, places them in the extraordinary time of the pre-Civil War era, and creates a world that is simultaneously understandable and monumental. This is a great book and a fun read. I'm looking forward to the future adventures in the series, because I have really begun caring about these characters! The book is profound without being preachy and offers a fresh look at a time and place that has been scrutinized for 150 years. REVIEW:I loved every bit of this book. It kept me up far too late each night reading just to see what was going to happen next. It was the first thing I picked up each morning. I just could not put it down until I had finished it. I liked the characters and felt like I was right there with them. Thank you Ms. Dye for showing that the Civil War was fought for more reasons than the right to own slaves. I can't wait to start on the next book in this series.

The historical aspect of it is meaningful to me because of the Civil War since I live near Gettysburg and have been to some of the places mentioned in the books, such as Hampton and Sharpsburg. As the author was talking about where the war took place in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, I could picture what the places look like now. I recommend this series to people who love historical fiction. I can't wait until the next book is released. REVIEW: The author provides enough detail for each character that you personally know them. The story is about the old south which is my cup of tea I love to read about the old Plantation Homes. I have visited many of the homes in Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas and the author is right on. The story line is great, Love the book.

This is one of the best historical books I have ever read. The characters come alive and I found I could hardly put it down. I cannot wait to begin the second and sm so glad there are eight. Wonderful author. REVIEW:If you like historical fiction, you will enjoy this. Well researched, and it makes you feel you are there. The author looks at things through the eyes of many characters, so you get many perspectives. I feel like I have learned a lot and am only on the second book of the series. REVIEW:Excellent book - looking forward to the remaining books in the series - great historical research, interesting and realistic characters - the events leading up to the Civil War , during the war and the aftermath - are all covered in this ""difficult to put down"" series .
