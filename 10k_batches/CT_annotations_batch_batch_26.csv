You may have seen the GFS model being shared all over talking a big storm for Iowa which has been wrong all along. The storm track has been south for days regardless of what models might want to show. This is why it's so important to add the human element to the forecast and not just modelcast. At this distance, southeast Iowa stands the best chance for any snow later next week. We will watch for any further trends south and adjust accordingly."

Because people of all ages, including youth you may know, don't feel safe or comfortable in their bodies, families, schools, communities, etc. when people of all gender identities aren't seen, accepted, and protected. To our trans and non-binary community members: We see you, celebrate YOU, and EHYSB is here for you! There are some other community spaces you may want to check out too.

Jewish, Israeli and Zionist students, student groups and faculty are regularly threatened, marginalized and harassed. Far too often, school administrators either turn a blind eye to the hostile environment for Jews and Israelis or contribute to it by failing to enforce school policies. The Lawfare Project provides guidance and legal assistance to students, professors, and campus groups who are the victims of anti-Semitism, anti-Israeli conduct and whose fundamental civil liberties have been violated. We do this in several ways: Advise adversely impacted parties on how to interact with school administrators and help determine steps for remedying a hostile environment both inside or outside of the classroom. Bring anti-Semitic and anti-Israel harassment and threats to the attention of school administrators. Conduct outreach to administrators and encourage them to enforce school policies and publicly condemn any and all forms of anti-Semitism that occur on campus, including anti-Israeli conduct that crosses the line into anti-Semitism. Work with our partners in the media to generate publicity surrounding the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel events that take place on college campuses. When the facts and circumstances warrant, take legal action to ensure that schools live up to their legal obligations to protect Jewish students from anti-Semitic harassment, intimidation, and discrimination."

The history of Juneteenth dates back on June 19, 1865, the horrific stains of slavery was finally deracinated from the origins of the Deep South. As all you may know the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) signed by Abraham Lincoln only liberated slaves who lived in Southern states with a Confederate presence. Once the slaves were liberated they were empowered to join the Union Army to abolish slavery. However, even the Civil War was officially over with the win of the Union Army the conflict to make slavery illegal was sluggish and demoralizing task. It wasn‚Äôt until June 19th, 1865. Within that same year, General Major Granger alongside his federal troops went to Galveston, Texas to recount the news that the Civil War was over and that slaves were officially liberated from slavery. With the exuberance that we were finally emancipated from slavery. With all that it is happening in the United States with protests and killing of unarmed African-Americans, remember Yahusha hasn‚Äôt brought the Black race this far to leave us, and uses our voices and actions to break the chains and DNA of racism off of this country. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ #myskinisnotaweapon #nojusticenopeace #endpolicebrutality #wematteracog #blackgirlmagic #melanin #blackisbeautiful #blackgirlsrock #connecticut #bridgeport #stopkillingus #Icantbreathe #minneapolis #blackinfluencers #blackdoctors #blacklawyers #blackvotesmatter #justiceforgeorgefloyd #justiceforusall #whatsleft #GeorgeFloyd #AhmaudArbery #BreonnaTaylor #Toomanytoname #blackmeniloveyou #blackwomeniloveyou #juneteenthcelebration #juneteenth"
