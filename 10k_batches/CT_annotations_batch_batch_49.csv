Among her many contributions is co-founding and founding and leading African American Policy Forum, an intersectional think tank behind campaigns such as #SayHerName, which calls attention to police violence against Black women and girls. #BlackHerstoryMonth"

The phrase further suggests ‚Äúotherness‚Äù and has since taken on racial connotations, as in not white; dull, savage, incompetent, dark, backwards; heathen; diabolic, transgressor, hence illegal.

It gives a place for you to not feel like you're learning, but the moment you step into the AAARCC, there's always something new to encounter. I, as a pre-Pharmacy major, love to learn and the AAARCC gives the perfect outlet of something that is the exact opposite of my current studies. The reading program introduced me to more people who were just as interested in learning about Asian and Asian American culture and I still say hello and talk to them today. It's a welcoming environment to those who want to learn about Asian/Asian American culture, no matter what background you come from. Dr. Pam Sari and Manabu Taketani are always looking to help support and uplift causes big and small on campus. By allowing so many different Asian Student Organizations on campus to host events (aside from the many they host on their own), it's become a second home for many, and I hope that more see the AAARCC the same way I do.

Did you know... - Sugar maples are the state tree of New York! - New York is home to the largest resource of tappable maple trees in the United States. - New York State ranks second in the nation for maple production, producing 804,000 GALLONS of maple syrup in 2020! - The alternation of both freezing and thawing temperatures is necessary to create the pressure which causes the sap to flow when sugar maple trees are tapped. Sap runs best when temperatures drop below freezing at night and rise into the 40s during the day, which is very common in March. That's why March is maple month! And a not-so-fun fact: ALL maple trees, including our precious syrup makers, are prone to devastation by the Asian Longhorn Beetle (ALB). Show your support to your local maple producers this season by visiting their sugarhouses for tours, tastings, and demonstrations throughout the state - AND show your support for their trees by reporting any signs of damage from Asian Longhorn Beetle to our ALB HOTLINE at (866) 265-0301. #invasivespecies #maplemonth #nysmaple #asianlonghornbeetle NYS Maple NYS Department of Environmental Conservation New York Invasive Species Research Institute"
