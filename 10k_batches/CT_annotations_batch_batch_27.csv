Juneteenth commemorates the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans learned they were free. While Confederate soldiers surrendered in April 1865, word didn’t reach the last enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas until June 19, 1865. While today is a day of celebration, we also reflect on the enduring legacy of slavery and racism that continues, 157 years later, to create worse outcomes for Black birthing people and babies. In 2022, Black women are 3-4 times more likely to die due to childbirth-related causes than white women. Black infants still die at a rate 2-3 times that of white infants. The vast majority of these deaths are preventable.

Here is the story, as told by D. Gregory Claiborne Butts in his book ""From Saddle To City By Buggy Boat and Railway"": Mr. Marchant and I were down there (Cedar Island in Back Bay) on another trip when we had the, to us, unusual experience of being present and lending some assistance to the Life Saving Service at Wash Woods and False Cape in landing a crew of eight Italians, seven Swedes and a negro from the wreck of the Bark ""Clythia,"" on its way from Genoa, Italy to Baltimore, Md., loaded with marble. The crews from the two stations named were on the beach, awaiting the subsidence of the sea, when Marchant and I arrived from the duck blind over in the marsh opposite False Cape. Bill Bowden carried us ashore quickly when both of us expressed the wish to visit the wreck. The captain came ashore first in the Breaches buoy to learn his whereabouts. He said that he thought he was entering Chesapeake Bay off Cape Henry, and was surprised to find himself ashore between two bars cut off from retreat until too late. He went back to the vessel in the buoy, and began sending his men ashore, one at a time; then he himself came. When the negro came he brought with him a large market basket, and in the basket a beautiful brown haired ducking dog, which he gave to John Williams. This splendid animal became the brood dog for scores of ducking dogs throughout that region, and died at last of old age."

""It was a rebellion, it was an uprising, it was a civil rights disobedience – it wasn't no damn riot."" DeLarverie says of the uprising. She fought back against the police, along with many others, and was brutally beaten. DeLarverie was the only drag king in the Jewel Box Review, the first racially integrated drag revue in the US. Throughout her life, Stormé continued to champion the LGBTQ community, and also regularly performed to raise money for battered women and children. Stormé worked as a nightclub bouncer until age 85 and died in 2014 at the age of 93. . . . [digital collage: faded background, street scene with the Jewel Box Review.

Johnson was one of the key leaders of the Stonewall uprising of 1969, an activist in the Gay Liberation movement and one of the first truth tellers on transgender life. She was also the founder of several organizations: Gay Liberation Front and Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.). Having become homeless on more than one occasion, Johnson was forced to resort to sex work, as she described ""in order survive."" As a result of this experience, she was a sounding alarm on AIDS and HIV. She brought to light the plight and ostracizing of so many transgender individuals who had to resort to sex work in order to make a living. There is much debate about her actual death, but what is certain is that Marsha was very much harassed by homophobic individuals and her complaints were ignored by police. Despite wanting to make her death a suicide due to past bouts with depression and mental illness, it was later reported that police just did not want to investigate the death of ""a black gay"" as a homicide. Marsha's fierceness for gay liberation and the acknowledgement of transgender individuals continues to influence the leaders of today. #ccsf #ccsfmovingyouforward #marshpjohnson #gay"

Our gut is the second brain. It’s lined with trillions of bacteria that digest food. The gut and brain communicate with each other through the vagus nerve. This is why we often see digestive issues in mental health disorders. One study out of Harvard (2018, Molecular Psychiatry) found that “changes in the gut microbiota can control brain insulin signaling and metabolite level which in turn impacts neurobehaviors.” Leaving the gut out of mental health treatment ignores the root cause. Who else geeks out over the gut health?"

In theory, the pretrial system is meant to ensure the equitable release of most individuals before trial while minimizing the risk of flight or danger to the public. In reality, however, defendants detained before trial represent over 75% of all jail inmates in some parts of the country, with significantly higher rates of pretrial detention among black and Hispanic individuals. Pretrial detention can also generate substantial spillover effects, as the costs of paying money bail and other related court fees and fines often fall on other family and community members of detained individuals. Many of these harms can result even when the period of incarceration is brief and even if individuals are not ultimately convicted of any crime. The U.S. criminal justice system has experienced a more than threefold expansion in the past several decades. More attention needs to be put into the economic costs of mass incarceration.

The plaque reads “The Stonewall Inn: The events that began at the stonewall inn in 1965 marked a monumental change for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) Americans, Stonewall, which occupied 51-53 Christopher Street, was a gay bar that was raided on June 28, 1969.

His signature style consists of flat colors and outlines, applying new media in the vein of Pop Art to images of everyday scenes. Earlier works remain self-reflective of his own experience, while more recent works are inspired by Library of Congress archival images. Through a contemporary lens, he blends classic imagery of Americana with brightly saturated hues. In acrylic on canvas, Walker Evans: Floyd Burroughs and Tengle Children, Hale County, Alabama documents the Great Depression in the United States. Francis references the archives of the U.S. Farm Security Administration to uncover subjects who express the trauma and resilience of the 1920s and 1930s. This work is a dramatic interpretation of a photograph of the same title, published in 1936 by renowned artist and writer, Walker Evans. Additionally, it is part of an extensive series, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, a collaborative book of Evans' work with text by James Agee. Transcending its original propaganda function, the image contextualizes the American identity in economic and social hardship. It documents the evolution and reconceptualization of Americana through the accessibility of digital archives. How do you believe digital media allows us to distort or reinterpret historical events?"

For Coach Brian Puckett, his career path has taken him from Rogersville, Alabama, but it will always be his home. One thing I love is when people leave where they consider home, but go back to give back to the place that meant so much to them. On Saturday, Coach Puckett, who is now the head strength and conditioning coach for LSU Basketball, made the over seven hour trip (he had a grand total of 30 hours to spare) from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Rogersville to share some of his experiences and knowledge with Lauderdale County High School athletes. I had the opportunity to have not only Coach Puckett on the show, but his mom, Amy, as well to share about his path from Rogersville to Baton Rouge. You can tune in just after 9 p.m. CST/10 p.m. EST tomorrow night (5/30) via FB Podcasts as Coach Puckett and Amy share a powerful message of resilience, strength, focus, and determination.

Listen / pre-order / more info at: jalopyrecords.bandcamp.com/album/songs-of-slavery-and-emancipation:=:https://jalopyrecords.bandcamp.com/album/songs-of-slavery-and-emancipation “These songs of slavery and emancipation, some written more than two hundred years ago, are not only important historically; they have a direct bearing on today’s movements for social and economic transformation. When you hear songs like “Nat Turner” or “Hymn of Freedom,” it’s almost as if they were written yesterday. They bring inspiration and revolutionary clarity to contemporary struggles."" - Kali Akuno Executive Director of Cooperation Jackson This double album presents recently discovered songs composed by enslaved people and explicitly calling for resistance to slavery. Some of the songs originate as early as 1800 and others as late as the outbreak of the Civil War. The project also includes long-lost songs of the abolitionist movement, some of which were written by fugitive slaves as well as free black people, challenging common misconceptions of abolitionism. Thirty one songs are presented in a beautiful hardcover bound double CD and digital download containing new performances in a traditional style by numerous contributing artists. An accompanying 64 page liner notes booklet includes complete lyrics as well as reproductions of historic documents. The liner notes also include essays by the album’s producer Mat Callahan, scholar Robin D.G. Kelley and activist organizer Kali Akuno. A companion full length book, to be published by the University Press of Mississippi, documents the sources of these newly released songs, as well as providing historic context: www.upress.state.ms.us/Books/S/Songs-of-Slavery-and-Emancipation:=:https://www.upress.state.ms.us/Books/S/Songs-of-Slavery-and-Emancipation #freedomsongs #abolition #resistancemovement #americanhistory #blm #blacklivesmatter #radicalhistory #shapenote #undergroundrailroad"

When I recently left my job with the Alabama State Council on the Arts to pursue my own artistic endeavors, it afforded me time to continue my exploration of Alabama and – in particular – the Black Belt, which had piqued my interest while at the Council.

So, come along and I’ll introduce you to some of the people and places that embody these perceptions. They’re all day trips from Montgomery, however, if you really want an in-depth experience, you can make your headquarters in Selma for a couple of nights and position yourself in the center of the action.
