This revolution resulted in the American Civil War. Stephens's speech is remembered by many for its defense of slavery, its outlining of the perceived differences between the North and the South, and the racial rhetoric used to show the inferiority of African Americans stating, in part, ""Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition."" A few weeks after the speech, on April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, initiating the American Civil War. #naacp #naacpsandiego #naacpsdremembers"

Last week, Middle School Math Teacher Nick Rahall delivered a Memorial Day Chapel, giving students time to reflect and prepare for a challenge that he issued as part of the holiday to commemorate those who gave their lives for our country. Mr. Rahall spoke about Lt. Michael Murphy, a Navy SEAL who lost his life while fighting heroically to save his comrades in Afghanistan in a surprise attack. The 2005 incident, for which Lt. Murphy was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, was the subject of the movie, ""Lone Survivor."" In addition, CrossFit gyms have created an extremely challenging workout, ""Murph,"" in his honor; it consists of 100 pullups, 200 pushups, and 300 squats, framed by two 1-mile runs. Mr. Rahall - a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and officer in the Marine Corps for several years - has accomplished that workout, and he encouraged students to try it, or to try to do any difficult activity over the weekend to honor those who died for our country."
