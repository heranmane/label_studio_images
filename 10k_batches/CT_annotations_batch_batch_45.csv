Lorde, a longtime social justice warrior, helped forge the blueprint to build communities that nurture our spirits and provide lessons learned on how love and radical self-care is essential to movements dismantling systemic injustice. Her radical perspectives helped pave the way for the contemporary radical Black feminists of today and created pathways for unity across the social divides she navigated in her own life. ‚ÄúI write for those women who do not speak, for those who do not have a voice because they were so terrified, because we are taught to respect fear more than ourselves.

You will be presented with challenges such as reading an article, listening to a podcast, reflecting on personal experience and more. Participation in an activity like this helps us to discover how racial injustice and social injustice impact our community, to connect with one another, and to identify ways to dismantle racism and other forms of discrimination. This is an exciting opportunity to dive deep into racial equity and social justice. YWCA Hartford Region wants to thank and acknowledge Dr. Eddie Moore Jr., Debby Irving, and Dr. Marguerite Penick for their leadership in the field of racial equity as exhibited in their 21 Day Racial Equity and Habit Building Challenge and the movement they helped to initiate.

Analysts told Reuters that the images of Huludao Port in Liaoning show a vessel that looks like a submarine, but it is unclear if it is an upgrade for an existing one or the development of a new class of boats. The Pentagon issued a report in November saying the Chinese navy was likely to build a new submarine with vertical launch capabilities designed for cruise missiles. Storage areas that are covered up near the submarine could house quieter propulsion equipment or missile launch tubes, analysts added. Vertical launch tubes would allow improved tracking capabilities of missiles fired from China‚Äôs submarines, improving their ‚Äúhunter-killer‚Äù capacity."

A bequest is property given in a will. One of the most popular ways to create an endowment is to mention the Jewish community as a bequest in your will. The simplest way to begin this process is by speaking with your estate planning attorney about your legacy wishes. A beneficiary is someone who is legally designated to receive the benefits of a trust, will, or life insurance policy. Naming the Jacobson Jewish Community Foundation as a beneficiary of your life insurance policy and/or IRA is a tax effective way to create an endowment.
