RESURRECTION: First, our collective memory must be restored so that we will understand what has happened to us and what must be done not only to improve this condition but to become what we should have been before we were side-tracked into thousands of seasons of White and Arab imposed slavery/servitude, carrying bags, crawling around converted, begging---a people being used and miss-used, hitched to the plow building the civilizations of others. We must study and prepare concrete, scientific knowledge of world history, and Africa's place in it. THIS IS THE WAKE-UP STAGE. II. REDEMPTION: Though modernized, we have fallen so much that we have nothing of substance that is our own. Our names, clothing, hair, languages, values, beliefs, religions, holidays, calendars, holy land, architecture, purposes in life---almost everything---we carbon copied from the White/Arab populations which enslaved our foremothers and fathers. Progressive African inner values, ethics, morals, and virtue must be restored by studying, improving, and implementing just African morals and behaviors. We redeem ourselves by respecting the best of what we were before we became something other than what we could, should, and still can become. We are more than what they have made us be. III. RECONSTRUCTION: Once we are awakened, cleansed, and organized to resolve the concrete problems that face us, we can stand-up like women and men in the face of any challenge in this life or the next. We must stop bending, we stop breaking, we stop lying down, and giving in at the hint of trouble. Then we will be on the path to being respected again. IV. RESTORATION: We reclaim our (1) African Self, (2) African Family, and (3) African Civilization by daily practical heroic deeds. We respect those who respect us, we care for our families, we prepare our best and our brightest, we defend those good in need, we stand tall facing all fear, we retake charge of our lives, we build in this life for the ages--again. V. REUNITE: UNITY, first, on the basis of color/culture, gender/sex, class, and age equality within the African population. Then break away from the oppressive/unjust world order of White/Arab over black, men over women, ruling capitalist class, old over new, and build within ourselves a higher, more humane African world order. We must build equality and justice from the ground up, relationship by relationship. VI. REBIRTH/RENAISSANCE: Give the Arabs and Whites their culture---their names, holidays, religions, clothing, hate of everything black, fraudulent histories, fake beliefs, languages, architecture, empty philosophies, hair weaves/straighteners, and other hate-care products, calendars, bad diets, and bad habits. Stand on the beautiful legacy of our ancient ancestors, before the invasions. Believe in Self, respect Self, defend Self, honor Self, and support Self. Spend every ounce of our energy, every second of our lives, every fiber of being, every moment rebuilding (stone by stone; person by person by person; institution by institution) a modernized/technologically advanced, morally sound, fiercely independent equally-founded African Civilization in our minds/morals first, then in Africa using the most advanced science and technology merged with Ancient African Kmt foundations of LIFE. THIS IS WHAT WE MUST DO. PLEASE NOTE: The seeds of the New Black Civilization already exist within the heads, hearts, and hands of those striving to reconstruct it.~ Tdka Maat Kilimanjaro LEARN MORE HERE: ON SALE NOW!

BWHI brought together health professionals, business executives and community leaders to create a three-part workplace equity initiative, which launched to a pilot group in September 2021. The first piece is placing employers within a corporate equity index, which scores them based on current policies and practices and how they impact the health of employees, Geter explains. Next is developing corporate fairness training specific to each employer, aimed at “shifting workplace culture” to acknowledge and address how bias is built into the work environment and processes, Geter says. Finally, the equity initiative provides an anti-racism wellness toolkit for Black women with guidance on how to set boundaries at work, tap health resources and find other ways they can take care of themselves while navigating microaggressions in the workplace.

Her father was a member of the Narragansett tribe and a city worker. Her mother was a cook, and both parents instilled in her a strong work ethic. Working as a domestic, Prophet saved her earnings in order to enter the Rhode Island School of Design in 1915, the first African American to do so, graduating in 1918. Prophet received commissions for her sculptured busts in Providence but soon turned again to domestic work in order to travel to France in 1922. Additional financial support came from fellow sculptor heiress Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Prophet spent 12 years in Paris studying classical sculpture. Her work was accepted in several French salons, where she exhibited life-size figural works. W.E.B. Du Bois and Contee Cullen, Harlem Renaissance notables, and artist Henry O. Tanner helped her show her French work in the United States. She won a Harmon Foundation Prize for Sculpture in 1929. Prophet returned to America in 1932 and exhibited widely in Rhode Island, New York, and Pennsylvania. The Whitney Museum in New York acquired her work; one of the first by an African American to enter their collection. Two years later, Prophet moved to Atlanta and taught at Atlanta University, where Hale Woodruff taught, and later at Spelman College, where she expanded its curriculum to include art history and fine arts. Both Prophet and Woodruff considered it their “…responsibility to encourage students to portray black experience in their work.” Woodruff established an annual Atlanta art exhibition that became the most important venue for showcasing African American art. Discouraged by racial segregation that lingered in the South, Prophet returned to Rhode Island in 1945. She was unsuccessful in reigniting her art career, so she returned to domestic work. Near her death, she acknowledged her Native American descent, but refused to accept her African-American ancestry. Prophet’s Paris diary (1922 to 1934) is in the collection of the John Hay Library at Brown University, Providence, RI."

We still celebrate those folks who can't come out right now; we still love and recognize you and support you and there is no shame in not coming out until it is safe and/or you're ready. Coming out as trans is particularly dangerous for BIPOC trans femmes, so we must recognize that it's a privilege to be able to come out and those who can do it safely are making it easier for those who can't right now. Trans and gender non-binary/gender non-conforming folks are a vital part of the Planned Parenthood community.

We're also constantly bombarded with requests to help advertise these and other ASL accessible events on our social media platforms. We wish we could help everyone promote their events, but it's just not humanly possible. Every day, it's a struggle for us to just keep up with what we need to get done for DQRC with the limited time and resources we're currently working with. Posting an event announcement may seem like a simple task, but it often isn't. Oftentimes, the announcement doesn't include image description information if it's a graphic and we have to spend the labor of getting this from the submitter or writing it ourselves. Then there are folks who have questions about the event and think we're hosting it because we posted it, and we have to spend energy and labor responding to those questions, directing them to the right source, among many other things. The time and labor add up and we estimated it would require at least an additional 10-20 hours per week of time for us to be able to take on these requests for everyone that asks. That's time we just don't have. This is one of the reasons we created the Deaf Queers & Allies group here on Facebook. We ask folks to post their event and other announcements there. The group has over 5K members and it's a great way to reach the Deaf LGBTQ communities. We thank you for understanding. xo *** The following is a link to our Social Media Policy that was developed in March 2020 to address this issue: https://www.facebook.com/deafqueer/photos/a.3135332463172664/2879139868791926"

Based on the acclaimed Israeli comedy-drama series “On the Spectrum” and executive produced by Emmy-winner Jason Katims (“Friday Night Lights,” “Parenthood”), “As We See It” follows three 20-something roommates on the autism spectrum (played by Sue Ann Pien, Rick Glassman and Albert Rutecki). Pien plays Violet, who is known for always displaying and verbally processing every feeling she has. While Violet often feels like an outsider, her greatest desire is to have the perfect job and boyfriend, like most people in their 20s. “This is the most personal character that I’ve ever played in my entire life,” Pien, who has autism, told NBC Asian America. “The first time I read the breakdowns and the script, I cried because there were so many parallels between what she was going through and what I had to go through in my own life.” When she first received the audition material for “As We See It” in the middle of 2019, Pien, a Los Angeles native best known for being a former Mars One candidate, was struck by the show’s acute level of awareness and later discovered that Katims has a son with Asperger syndrome. “I think it’d be really hard for somebody who isn’t on the spectrum to portray these types of authentic moments of life that happen, that you can’t even describe unless you’ve been there,” Pien said. “Jason approaches this with so much love, and I can only imagine the father he is, and I know he has an incredible family. It was healing for me, as a person on the spectrum, but I hope for many, many families with loved ones on the spectrum or who are autistic themselves.” In a statement, Katims said he wanted to “live inside the experience of what it means to be on the autism spectrum, rather than take an outsider’s view,” which meant that it was imperative to cast the trio at the heart of the show as authentically as possible.

Share this post with a fisherman or woman you know! Loose fishing line kills and entangles wildlife, causes boat damage, and DOES NOT biodegrade. So make sure to dispose of your line properly by recycling it at a station or by mail to the Berkeley Recycling Collection Center (1900 18th street, Spirit Lake, Iowa 51360-1099).

The perspectives of #BlackFeminists have consistently transformed the fights for gender equity and racial justice to ensure we can continue to build a world of equity, justice, and freedom for all. That’s why, all this month, we’re celebrating Black feminism and centering the work of powerful Black sheroes past and present doing the critical intersectional work to #EliminateRacism and #EmpowerWomen. Follow along all month long as we center the unsung legacy of Black feminism: from Jane Crow to Intersectionality."
