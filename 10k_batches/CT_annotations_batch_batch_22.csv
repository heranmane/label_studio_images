Dr. Alexa Irene Canady is no exception, as the first Black woman neurosurgeon in the United States. Read more about Dr. Canady‚Äôs accomplishments below. . . Alexa Irene Canady, MD, was a pioneer of her time, both for women physicians and the Black community, when she became the first Black woman neurosurgeon in the United States in 1981. ‚ÄúThe greatest challenge I faced in becoming a neurosurgeon was believing it was possible,‚Äù she is famously quoted. Born in 1950, Canady grew up in Lansing, Michigan, where her father was a dentist and her mother an educator. She graduated from the University of Michigan in 1971 with a degree in zoology, and it was during her undergraduate studies that she attended a summer program in genetics for minority students and fell in love with medicine.Canady went on to graduate cum laude from the College of Medicine at the University of Michigan. She initially wanted to be an internist but became intrigued by neurosurgery during her first two years of medical school. It was a career path that some advisers discouraged her from pursuing, and she encountered difficulties in obtaining an internship. But she persisted. Eventually, Canady was accepted as a surgical intern at Yale-New Haven Hospital in 1975, breaking another barrier as the first woman and first African American to be enrolled in the program. After years as a successful neurosurgeon, Canady retired from her position in 2001 and relocated to Florida with her husband. Her retirement was short-lived, however, when she learned there were no pediatric neurosurgeons in her immediate area and began to practice part-time at Pensacola‚Äôs Sacred Heart Hospital. Canady officially retired from practicing medicine a second time in 2012. She continues to be an advocate for encouraging young women to pursue careers in medicine and neurosurgery.

She has been a long time sponsor of YWCA Greater Austin."" Wilhelmina Ruth Delco (born July 16, 1929) is an American politician who served in the Texas House of Representatives. Wilhelmina Delco took a leading role in advocating for civil rights in Austin, first as a member of the Austin School Board, then as a 20-year member of the Texas House of Representatives. She was the first African American elected to public office in Austin. Today, she says the protests that have galvanized many people in the wake of George Floyd's death have her feeling optimistic. She was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame in 1986. In 1968, Delco was elected to the board of trustees for the Austin Independent School District, becoming the first African American elected to public office in Austin.

The novel stood out among literary critics because it features all white characters, unlike the civil rights activist's other novels which center the experiences of black people. Baldwin spent a majority of his literary and activist career educating others about black and queer identity, as he did during his famous lecture titled ‚ÄúRace, Racism, and the Gay Community‚Äù at a meeting of the New York chapter of Black and White Men Together (now known as Men of All Colors Together) in 1982.

batch_22,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heranmane/label_studio_images/main/10k_batches/batch_22/57259-7768781603196062.png,"The following statement was issued by the National Alliance Against Racist & Political Repression in response to the hearing of Anthony Gay on Friday, June 17th: On June 17th, 2022, Anthony Gay had a court hearing at the United States District Court of Central Illinois. This hearing was in response to a motion he filed to be released from Peoria County Jail and put on electronic monitoring while he awaits sentencing, currently scheduled to take place in mid-September. Anthony was taken into custody of the Peoria County Jail on May 20th, 2022, and since then has had only four showers and been allowed to brush his teeth only four times. Frank Chapman, Executive Director of the National Alliance, stated, ‚ÄúAnthony is awaiting sentencing on a framed-up gun charge brought against him by the Rock Island Police Department.‚Äù In the hearing Anthony Gay‚Äôs lawyer, Jennifer Soble of the Illinois Prison Project, made a strong series of arguments why further incarceration would be catastrophic for his well-being. The court‚Äôs own psychological evaluation diagnosed Anthony with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder resulting from the 22 years in solitary confinement by the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). Three different psychologists submitted evaluations supporting the fact that Anthony has PTSD that will only be worsened by further incarceration. Attorney Soble also presented a plan for Anthony‚Äôs care once released onto electronic monitoring. She argued that Anthony has been most successful at managing his mental health when he is able to remain in contact with his support network and engage in activism. Not only is this evidence that Anthony would benefit from not being confined while awaiting sentencing, but it is also evidence that he does not pose a danger to the community and is not at risk of fleeing, which is exactly what needs to be proven to justify the motion. According to Chapman, ‚ÄúThe response of the prosecution - the same prosecution that Anthony faced in his unfair trial - was to make unfounded claims about Anthony‚Äôs mental health conditions.‚Äù The source for these claims was the ruling of a judge from a court proceeding that did not include testimony from psychologists or experts with any knowledge of psychological conditions. The prosecution claimed Anthony was diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and even ‚Äúsexual sadism.‚Äù They alleged that Anthony was attempting to ‚Äúmanipulate his conditions,‚Äù and described him several times as ‚Äúmanipulative.‚Äù Chapman stated further, ‚ÄúThey presented these racist, unscientific claims as though they were evidence, as they have many times throughout the proceedings in this case.‚Äù The prosecution also raised as evidence the 18 convictions Anthony received while incarcerated in IDOC, claiming he had attacked guards and other inmates. Attorney Soble pointed out that the majority of these convictions were either instances where Anthony was convicted of destruction of property for engaging in self harm, or instances in which he spit at guards and was then charged with aggravated battery. She explained that she has 65 clients held in IDOC, and that every one of them has an aggravated battery charge for spitting at a guard on their record. Judge James Shadid did not issue his ruling at the end of the hearing today and said he will need a few days to think it over and will issue a statement in the coming week. Chapman concluded, ‚ÄúWe eagerly await the results of his deliberation, and we continue to raise our demand loud and clear: Free Anthony Gay! Free All Political Prisoners!‚Äù"

Yet historically, ""mainstream"" environmentalism has often left women of color out of the conversation, and off decision-making tables. This week, as we continue to celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we're highlighting 5 Asian American and/or Pacific Islander WEA Leaders who are leveraging their voices, passion, and leadership to transform the climate crisis into climate solutions. üåè Sanjana Paul is creating environmental justice and climate solutions through engineering as the Executive Director & Co-Founder of @earthhacksorg, and the Atmospheric Science Software Developer at @NASA. She started Earth Hacks to support students to create environmental hackathons, with the intention of providing resources, support, and spaces for students of all backgrounds to explore their ideas and turn their environmental anxiety into action. üåè Liz Lee is not only a leader in her work and faith community‚Å†‚Äîwhere she serves as #ClimateJustice Lead for United Methodist Women and is using faith to grow a culture of climate justice and gender equity. She's also paying it forward within our Alliance as well‚Å†‚Äîafter participating in our 2019 U.S. Accelerator, Liz came back as a mentor to the next year's cohort, supporting more women leaders just like her to scale their work and deepen their impact. üåè Yakuta Poonawalla is a shining, joyful light amidst what can sometimes be heavy work. Born and raised in India, Yakuta currently works with the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy where she leads community stewardship initiatives that create a safe space for exploration, provide healing, and inspire people to find their connection with nature. üåè Rozina Kanchwala is taking a global, intersectional approach to climate change through her work with The Clean Energy Leadership Institute. Not only is she dedicated to making climate engagement accessible and inspiring, and she's also planning to take her vision international by creating a green jobs training program in Pakistan that addresses the impact climate change has on the country and the dual challenge of unemployment and underemployment. üåè Melody Zhang is a writer and storyteller, who is creating a cultural shift within the church around issues of climate. Specifically, she's using her voice to build a church network of climate advocates in Washington D.C. with @sojogram."

But Johnson was destined to make his mark by becoming a businessman and entrepreneur of a multi-million dollar cosmetic business. In 1944, Johnson went to work as a production chemist for a Black-owned cosmetics firm, S.B. Fuller. With the encouragement of co-worker and chemist, Herbert Martin, Johnson left Fuller in 1954 to establish his own, Johnson Products Company. Johnson Products specialized in Black haircare, initially targeting men with the Ultra Wave Hair Culture relaxer. Soon after, in 1957, he introduced the Ultra Sheen line for women, which skyrocketed in sales and fame. In the 1960s, Johnson was also the exclusive sponsor of the popular show ""Soul Train."" He even founded Independence Bank in 1964. In 1971, Johnson Products became the first Black-owned company listed on the American Stock Exchange. After years of great success, in 2004, Johnson Products was purchased by the Proctor and Gamble Corporation and again in 2009 by a consortium of African American investment firms. #BlackHistoryMonth"
