The promotion on Tuesday announced the full fight lineup for the spring event, which is headlined by a featherweight title fight between champ Alexander Volkanovski and The Korean Zombie (otherwise known as Chan Sung Jung). A bantamweight title rematch between champ Aljamain Sterling and interim titleholder Petr Yan co-headlines. The title tilts were originally scheduled to headline UFC 272 on March 5, but they were moved after Volkanovski’s original opponent, ex-champ Max Holloway, was ruled out of the event. Jung stepped in as a replacement after a bevy of top featherweights called for a title shot. Sterling and Yan originally were set to meet at UFC 267, but a lingering neck injury forced Sterling to withdraw, prompting the promotion to put on an interim title fight between Yan and Cory Sandhagen, which Yan won via decision. Yan’s undisputed title was captured by Sterling via disqualification in their first meeting at UFC 258 when he landed an illegal knee that rendered Sterling unable to continue.

How can you practice consent in your daily life? - Ask for permission before you touch anyone- including family members and children- and let them know that it’s safe to say “no” if they don’t want to be touched. - Respect privacy. Don’t share information that is not yours to share. - -- Refrain from going through personal belongings without permission. - Be mindful of others’ emotional boundaries. For example, consider asking “Is it okay if we talk about this?” or “Do you have the energy to discuss this right now?” before heavy conversations. By practicing consent in everyday situations, you show others that you value their choices and limits. #SAAM2022"

Read more about Manjirō’s life below: Nakahama Manjirō was born in Japan on January 27, 1827. He became the man of the family at the age of 8 after his father passed away and at fourteen years old, he started working on a fishing boat. On January 13, 1841 the fishing boat was caught in a terrible storm causing it to crash into Tori-shima Island. Manjirō and the other fisherman were stranded on the island until June 27 when a whaling ship, captained by William Whitfield, spotted the men and came to their aid. While boarding Captain Whitfield’s boat, they realized they could not communicate with each other and began using hand gestures to communicate. For the next few months, the men sailed the North Pacific waters catching whales until they finally docked in Oahu in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). When preparing to leave, Captain Whitfield asked Manjirō to continue sailing with him to America. Manjirō and Captain Whitfield arrived in Fairhaven, Massachusetts in May 1843 (age 16). On May 16, 1846, three years after settling in America, Manjirō decided to set sail and head back home to Japan. After a couple of setbacks, Manjirō arrived to his hometown in January of 1851 where he was welcomed home by his mother. After his arrival home, Manjirō was named a samurai and worked as a political emissary between his home country and the West. Manjirō suffered a mild stoke in 1871, which did permanent damage to his body. Later in 1898, he died in his son’s home at age 71. #AAPIHeritageMonth #AsianAmericanHeritage #PacificIslanderHeritage"

O Allah we thank you for giving us more life and more time and more opportunity to do good deeds and to please you and the opportunity to earn the Paradise. So many have Died and have went ahead of us and we will also go ahead of others also. Lot of things going on as usual, with a lot of Deaths and people Dying and many Janazahs in last few days and last week and more lined up for the next few days. Subhanallah so many Deaths it is just overwhelming. All of them emotional, tragic and sad for their family and friends. Our Janazah last Tuesday was for Joshua Dreyling, from St Paul. He was a Revert brother who embraced Islam few years ago. He tragically Died last week and we buried him last Tuesday. Though his family was Catholic, they allowed us to bury him and give him a proper Janazah. His family was very thankful and appreciative of the preparation and burial he was given. They said: ""We are grateful and thankful to the Muslims for taking such good care of him and standing by us during this difficult time."" Alhamdulillah we were able to bury him as a Muslim. Alhamdulillah they also have a friend who is a Muslim and so they are very respectful of Islam and may be even be close to becoming Muslim. They have utmost respect for Islam and Muslims. And this Janazah has brought them even closer. They appreciated the Janazah and the few Muslims who came for the Janazah. Of course they had a large turnout of family and friends. Unfortunately not many Muslims came, inspite of being informed and encouraged to come. It seems our Reverts are left alone and abandoned when they Die and hardly nobody comes for their Janazah. We always inform the community that only their non-Muslim family will come for their Janazah, so it is important that we come out to not only fulfill our Duty and Responsibility, but to also show our concern and support for our fellow Muslim brother or Sister. Unfortunately we haven't understood or realized how important it is or that it is a DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY IN ISLAM. KNOWN AS FARD KIFAYAH. So many times our Reverts are not given Janazah and are buried as Christians or even Cremated. So we don't realize how important it is to stand by and support our Revert brothers and sisters. So many times we have to fight and struggle to get their bodies and to make sure that they get a Janazah and buried as a Muslim. And the least and small thing we can do is to come to their Janazah. The opposite scenario is a high profile Janazah of a person who Died and from a big Qabeela, or was well known in the community, or just a high profile case of a tragic murder or accident, and out of curiosity everybody feels that they need to come. Then the turn out is Overwhelming. As we know Islam is not about Qabeela, Tribe, Country or Nationality, but is about what really joins us together, La illaha illallah, Muhammadur Rasoolullah. The Prophet also said "" A Muslim is a brother to his brother Muslim."" And the real issue is if we never come for others how do we expect others to come for us. And now we also have another Revert brother that also Died few days ago. His Janazah will be in few days. He also does not have Muslim family, so looks like he will also be buried alone wiith no one to come for his Janazah. This is the sad state that we see over and over again, that people don't seem to feel brotherhood or any connection with our Revert brothers who have taken Shahadah. Alhamdulillah a few people always do show up, but not many. Perhaps last time we saw maybe 8 or 10 people. Alhamdulillah, may Allah reward them for their time and effort in coming. May Allah grant them a high place in Jannah. For they fulfilled the Obligation and Responsibility of the 200,000 Muslims of the Twincities."
