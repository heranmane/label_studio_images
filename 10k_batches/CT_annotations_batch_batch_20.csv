Maangchi has a popular youtube channel where she shares her Korean recipes with followers all over the world. Her recipes are straightforward with enticing pictures and delicious results. I have tried a ton of her recipes, including Kimchi Stew (김치찌개), Chive Pancakes (부추전), Bibimbap (비빔밥), Pan-Fried Marinated Eggplant (가지양념구이), Garlicky Cooked Soybean Sprouts (콩나물무침), Pickled Radish for Fried Chicken (치킨무), Tteokbokki (떡볶이), and Gimbap (김밥). When I was living in South Korea, kimchi stew was one of my favorite foods. Maangchi’s Kimchi Stew is super easy to make since all you do is combine the ingredients and boil them until the pork is cooked. It is the perfect choice for a weeknight dinner when you are craving a warm, hearty stew. You need to use pork belly because the fat gives the stew flavor and prevents the pork from becoming too tough. Cooking the kimchi mellows out its flavor, making it savory instead of sour, so I highly recommend people try this dish even if they aren’t a fan of raw kimchi. Of course, this dish is also perfect for people who love kimchi. I added sliced winter melon to my stew because it has a lovely texture and absorbs the spicy flavor of the kimchi. My family enjoyed this dish so much that I made two batches and we ate it for two weeks. It reheats well in the microwave so it’s also a great choice for packed lunches. Overall, I love Maangchi’s cookbooks and I highly recommend them.” Maangchi"

The kids are dealing with a loss of structure and education, with anxiety and stress, and with experiencing military actions (think shelling, explosions, bomb shelters). . This fundraiser is to help them. . I have absolutely incredible news about this project that I will be announcing next week. Please follow @theexpertally to learn about the next steps for this project. . In every human disaster, people with disabilities are affected in additional ways. Autistic kids in this war struggle in many additional ways. Large charities are not set up to meet their needs. This project fills this gap for as many families as possible. Help us and watch this project grow. Donate here: https://www.theexpertally.com/ukraine-fundraising."

Bayard Rustin’s life-long commitment to nonviolence began with his Quaker upbringing and the influence of his grandmother, whose participation in the NAACP resulted in leaders of the Black community, such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Mary McLeod Bethune, visiting the Rustin home during his childhood. Bayard Rustin served as an advisor to Rev. Dr. King during the Montgomery Bus Boycott, was a lead organizer of the March On Washington, and was integral in forming the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He was also a labor organizer, and an organizer of youth in the fight for school integration. Despite his devotion to the Civil Rights movement, he was constantly scrutinized as a leader because he was gay and had former ties to the Communist Party. His involvement with the Communist Party ended abruptly when the chapter of the Young Communist League he was part of shifted away from the Civil Rights Movement as a key issue in 1941. As a gay man in leadership of a primarily Christian movement, Bayard Rustin often goes unmentioned. The suppression of his name in this movement was largely due to stigma against gay men, and highlights the painful decision many people with intersecting identities were (and are) forced to make when advocating for their humanity. #BlackHistoryMonth #EliminatingRacism #ywcaisonamission #YWCAKzoo ID: A black and whtie image of Bayard Rustin."

She was 106. Artist Antonio Bechara told The New York Times that Herrera had died at her Manhattan home Saturday. Fame finally came at age 89, when Herrera sold her first painting in 2004. It may have taken 60 years for Herrera to be discovered, but today her paintings — minimalist compositions of straight lines, form and color — are found in permanent collections of major museums including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London. “The core to Carmen Herrera’s painting is a drive for formal simplicity and a striking sense of color,” according to the London-based Lisson Gallery. “A master of crisp lines and contrasting chromatic planes, Herrera creates symmetry, asymmetry and an infinite variety of movement, rhythm and spatial tension across the canvas.” In 2009, the Observer of London asked, “How can we have missed these beautiful compositions?” Herrera said she painted because she had to. “It’s a compulsion that also gives me pleasure. I never in my life had any idea of money and I thought fame was a very vulgar thing. ... And at the end of my life, I’m getting a lot of recognition, to my amazement and my pleasure,” she said in a 2009 interview. Born in Havana, Cuba, in 1915, Herrera was the daughter of the founding editor of the Havana-based newspaper El Mundo and a mother who was a reporter. She studied architecture at a university in Havana, and moved frequently between Cuba and Paris during the 1930s and 1940s. She trained at the Art Students League in New York where she settled in the mid-1950s after marrying Jesse Lowenthal, a teacher of literature at Stuyvesant High School. He died in 2000. Working as a female artist in postwar America was a difficult challenge, she said. “People were not ready to receive my work,” Herrera told the Observer in 2010. She recalled how an avant-garde New York gallery owner told her bluntly, “'Carmen, you can paint circles around the men artists that I have but I’m not going to give you a show because you’re a woman.'” But being an unknown artist had its advantages, she said; it meant she could work to please herself, not someone else. In the late 2000s, she had solo exhibitions at the Museum Pfalzgalerie Kaiserslautern in Germany and the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, England, and a decade earlier at the Museo del Barrio in New York. Herrera’s art is also found in many other museums including the Hirshhorn Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, as well as the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis."

A cause of death has not been announced. In January 2020, Byun's story made international headlines when she sued the South Korean military for discharging her after she underwent gender affirmation surgery in 2019. Byun had been hoping to serve in the country's female corps, but her military reinstatement was rejected in July 2020, per the BBC. The decision to not reinstate Byun was criticized by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. 'It was an extremely difficult decision to let my base know of my identity, but once I did, I felt much better,' Byun said in 2020. She added, 'Apart from my gender identity, I want to show everyone that I can also be one of the great soldiers who protect this country.' South Korea requires all 'able-bodied' men to serve about two years in its military. Byun's case also shed light on the ways South Korea remains largely conservative when it comes to the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the country; according to the BBC, the country has no laws preventing anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination. The announcement of Byun's death led to an outpouring of support across social media on Wednesday. She was 23."

Today, on KYN, we are joined by Cruz Tecumseh Collin from the Lakota Nation to discuss the life of indigenous people in the contemporary world. Cruz Tecumseh Collin, commonly known as Wankatuya Keya in his native community, is one of the youngest and most active Kectil alumni. He was an outstanding colleague in the 2021 Kectil Program. Early this year, Cruz was appointed Regional Coordinator from the Lakota Nation, where he supports several Kectil Colleagues on the programme. Cruz is currently based in Toulouse, France, where he joins his mother in conducting research on the nexus between tradition and medical research. Cruz and his family are determined to preserve the beautiful history and culture of the Lakota Nation. As much as indigenous people make up only an estimated 5% of the world's population, they have different backgrounds, cultures, and traditions. They often have a shared history of being uprooted and forced from their ancestral lands. For instance, the Lakota people live in the Black Hills of South Dakota, which under an international treaty belonged to the Lakota people, but the US Government still passed a treaty to take hold of them in 1877. Listen to Cruz take Daniel through the Lakota people’s long and beautiful history, and culture as well as how they live in the broader American community today.

The former Negro Leagues star is credited with hitting almost 800 home runs over his 17-year career and was such a fearsome hitter that many fans called him the “black Babe Ruth."" Gibson ultimately became the second-highest-paid player in the Negro Leagues behind another legend, Satchel Paige. Unfortunately, Gibson never got a chance to play in the majors.

This class requires you to step out of your comfort zone to make the most of it. This class is unlike any other I have attended. Why? You will need to be ready to participate in discussions, share your honest thoughts, and reflect deeply on these names and attributes of Allah so that we can apply them in our daily lives and strengthen our personal connection with Allah. In this way, we will not only learn more about Allah through Their names, but we can also gain a new perspective by listening to others share their thoughts and feelings.
