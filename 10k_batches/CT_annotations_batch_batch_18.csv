Kaufman Salon - Jun 30, 2022, 10:07 AM EDT The Supreme Court just made it much harder for the U.S. government to respond to climate change in a 6-3 decision in the case of West Virginia v. EPA. The Thursday decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by the other five conservative justices, preemptively strikes down any regulations the Biden administration might consider issuing under a provision of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon emissions at power plants.

The historical aspect of it is meaningful to me because of the Civil War since I live near Gettysburg and have been to some of the places mentioned in the books, such as Hampton and Sharpsburg. As the author was talking about where the war took place in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, I could picture what the places look like now. I recommend this series to people who love historical fiction. I can't wait until the next book is released. REVIEW: The author provides enough detail for each character that you personally know them. The story is about the old south which is my cup of tea I love to read about the old Plantation Homes. I have visited many of the homes in Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas and the author is right on. The story line is great, Love the book. REVIEW: Ginny Dye takes very ordinary people, places them in the extraordinary time of the pre-Civil War era, and creates a world that is simultaneously understandable and monumental. This is a great book and a fun read. I'm looking forward to the future adventures in the series, because I have really begun caring about these characters! The book is profound without being preachy and offers a fresh look at a time and place that has been scrutinized for 150 years.

The terror and fear that we may have our lives stolen by a police officer who deems themself judge, jury, and executioner is overwhelming.⁠ ⁠ “Isaiah Brown should not be hospitalized in critical condition. He should be living his life as he has always lived it – in service to others as an essential worker and health aide. All reporting indicates that Brown complied with orders, which included raising his arms with his cell phone in hand, and informing the 911 dispatcher he was unarmed ahead of police arrival. ⁠ ⁠ “Isaiah’s Black and gay/same gender loving identity will likely make it more difficult for his family to attain accountability for the officer responsible. Still, Black LGBTQ+ people continue to die by violence, often unreported, perpetrated by police officers and other state-sanctioned actors who do not value Black Lives Matter. ⁠ ⁠ “We echo the Brown family’s demands that all audio recordings associated with this shooting be released to the public. Additionally, that the police officer in question, who made careless and basic errors while violating police protocols, should be held accountable. ⁠ ⁠ “We will continue to advance efforts that aim to reform national policy in an attempt to prevent this from happening to another member of our community again.” ⁠ ⁠ Full Statement: https://nbjc.org/leading-civil-rights-group-on-police-shooting-of-isaiah-brown/"

In 1967, Israel extended this policy to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it has occupied ever since. Amnesty International has analysed Israel’s intent to create and maintain a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians and examined its key components: territorial fragmentation; segregation and control; dispossession of land and property; and denial of economic and social rights. It has concluded that this system amounts to apartheid. It has also documented unlawful acts committed by Israel against Palestinians with the intent to maintain this system, including forcible transfers, administrative detention and torture, unlawful killings, denial of basic rights and freedoms and persecution. It has concluded that such acts form part of a systematic as well as widespread attack directed against the Palestinian population and amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid. Israel must dismantle this cruel system and the international community must pressure it to do so. All those with jurisdiction over the crimes committed to maintain the system should investigate them."

According to Ms. Magazine: “Maternal mortality is one of the most compelling indicators that America runs on racism. Here’s what we need to do to overcome this legacy and current reality.” WGBH Boston reported: “Despite all the modern advances in medical care, pregnancy and birthing can be dangerous for women of color. Massachusetts boasts some of the best hospitals in the world, yet here in the Bay State, Black women are nearly two times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. It’s a sobering statistic, and racism is largely to blame, local experts [claim} … Black women are often disregarded and ignored when raising concerns about their symptoms.” Hulu is about to release a documentary on Black maternal mortality entitled Aftershock: “The statistics speak for themselves: According to the CDC, Black and Native women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women in this country. “Aftershock” is the result of tragedy, and the collaborative efforts of families who have endured the outcomes of systemic racial discrimination in reproductive health.” But for every complex problem there is a solution that is clear, simple … and more than likely wrong. Such is the case with the effort to place the blame for the massive rates of Black maternal mortality on racism. While it is depressingly true that racism in America is active, ugly and apparently growing, the statistics about race and maternal mortality do speak for themselves — and they show there is no clear relationship between racism and maternal mortality. Black people are hardly the only victims of racism in the US. Latinos, Native Americans and those of Asian descent are also victimized. If racism were the proximate cause of maternal mortality we would expect to see mortality rates among ethnic groups proportionate to the likelihood of racism. But that’s not what we find. Below are the latest maternal mortality statistics from the CDC. If racism were the cause of maternal mortality we would expect Hispanic women to have maternal mortality rates substantially higher than those of white women but not as high as Black women. Yet that’s not what we find. Instead Hispanic women have maternal mortality rates even lower than those of white women. So discrimination is not linearly related to maternal mortality. That’s in contrast to factors like age and socio-economic status that are linearly related suggesting that — unlike racism — they are major contributors to maternal mortality. If racism were the cause of increased mortality it would not be confined just to the weeks and months after birth. Overall mortality would also reflect the level of discrimination. Yet that’s not what we find. Instead Hispanic people have the highest life expectancy. Mortality statistics from the CDC are below. Moreover, women — who arguably face much higher rates of discrimination than men —nonetheless have higher life expectancy. In my view, blaming racism as the primary driver of Black maternal mortality while satisfying to some is too easy and likely to be ineffective since there is no clear relationship of racism to mortality. Consider that cardiovascular disorders are the leading cause of maternal mortality in the US, and Black women have higher rates of pregnancy-related heart attack, stroke, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary embolism than White women, even when differences in age, health conditions, cesarean section rate, socioeconomic factors, and access to health care are taken into account. Blaming racism isn’t going to help these women avoid cardiac complications or recover from them. That would require a commitment to increase the number of perinatologists and obstetric ICUs and to provide expensive interventions. It’s much easier and cheaper to pretend that Black doulas could improve maternal outcomes by ameliorating racism. I would never deny the existence of virulent racism in the US. But just because racism exists and Black women die in appalling numbers does not mean that the former causes the latter. I fear that as long we focus on racism, and not on providing high tech obstetric care, Black women will continue to die in heart-breaking numbers.

Taylor was an Black woman from Abbeville in Henry County, Alabama. She was born and raised in a sharecropping family in the Jim Crow era Southern United States. Taylor's refusal to remain silent about her rape by white men led to organizing for justice and civil rights in the African-American community. On September 3, 1944, Taylor was kidnapped while leaving the church and gang-raped by six white men. Despite the men's confessions to authorities, two grand juries subsequently declined to indict the men; no charges were ever brought against her assailants. In 2011, the Alabama Legislature officially apologized on behalf of the state ""for its failure to prosecute her attackers."" Taylor's rape, refusal to remain silent and the subsequent court cases were among the early instances of nationwide protest and activism among the African-American community and ended up providing an organizational spark in the civil rights movement. At the 2018 Golden Globe Awards, while accepting the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, Oprah Winfrey discussed and brought awareness to Taylor's story. The Congressional Black Caucus led Democratic Caucus members in wearing red ""Recy"" pins while attending the 2018 State of the Union, where Taylor's granddaughter, Mary Joyce Owens, was a guest. #NCBCRemembers Source: NY Times 12/29/2017"

After many tests, it was discovered that he had Large Diffuse B Cell Lymphoma. This slow growing cancer had kind of taken over that leg. He went through many chemo treatments and we thought he was on a path to recovery. However, in the summer of 2021, the cancer was back, full force. He had developed what is called Richter’s transformation. This causes a normally slow growing lymphoma to become rapidly growing and incredibly aggressive. Before we knew it, the cancer had taken over his right leg, had attacked his skull, ribs, and hips. The oncology team at Presbyterian St. Luke’s in Denver tried all they knew to try. From chemo to radiation, to amputation of his right leg. But, the cancer ultimately took over his body and we lost him on January 5th, 2022.

Images of Israeli teenagers at a public school event enthusiastically engaging in blackface. Acting out a grotesque scene of white masters whipping chained boys painted brown from head to toe. This cannot be dismissed as an issue of cultural mistranslation. This is not a matter of Israeli society having a different historical relationship with race, racism, and blackface. This was indisputably an act of bigotry and dehumanization targeting black people; in particular, African descendants of slavery. Blackface has no place in Israeli society. Notwithstanding, the general impropriety of “dressing up” as a specific race or ethnic group as one might “dress up” as a tiger or a gorilla, doing so in the context of role playing crimes against humanity, is especially egregious. If non-Jews were to dress up as Nazis and Jews; role playing men donning enlarged noses and Jewfros being marched into a gas chamber, we would be united in our condemnation. Yet, some within our community give this racism a pass because of where it happened: Israel. This excuse is unacceptable. There are thousands of African American & Caribbean Jews in the USA whose ancestors were the survivors of race-based slavery. Many of these fellow Jews have made Aliyah and are no less Israeli than the high schoolers who were in blackface. An individual’s inability to grasp or accept the true diversity of the Jewish people in the Diaspora or Israel is NOT an excuse for bigotry. Israeli society is meant to serve as a beacon of moral righteous. As such, the moral turpitude demonstrated by these young Israeli men on Purim (a day we should be celebrating Jewish unity) is a disgrace deserving all forms of condemnation from all Israelis."
