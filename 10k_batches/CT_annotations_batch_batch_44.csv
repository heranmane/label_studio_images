Who is eligible? Those 65 years or older and/or have a disability as defined by the Social Security Act are eligible for a Property Tax Refund if they have applied through Minnehaha or Lincoln County and are approved for South Dakota’s Assessment Freeze for the Elderly and Disabled program. Additional requirements including income limits, home market value, and more can be found on the City’s website here: siouxfalls.org/proptaxrefund:=:https://siouxfalls.org/proptaxrefund. How do people apply? Applications for South Dakota’s Assessment Freeze for the Elderly and Disabled program can be filed with the homeowner’s county treasurer’s office annually on or before April 1. Applicants must apply every year in order to remain eligible for a refund. How much money can people receive? The tax refund amount is 100% of the municipal property tax due up to a maximum refund of $500. The City of Sioux Falls will receive a list of qualified individuals and addresses directly from Minnehaha County and Lincoln County and will automatically issue refunds. The continuation of this program is subject to City Council approval annually by resolution. Refunds are issued the year after the homeowner qualifies for the Assessment Freeze for the Elderly and Disabled. For example, with City Council approval to continue the program, if the applicant applies by April 1, 2022, and is approved for an assessment freeze, they will receive a property tax refund in 2023.

Here’s some extra inspiration to get you through the day from the endlessly inspiring Shirley Chisholm! Shirley Anita Chisholm solidified her place in history as the first African-American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, and was the first woman of any race to run for President in 1972. Born to a Guyanese father and Barbadian mother in the heart of Brooklyn, Shirley Chisholm dedicated her life to improving opportunities for inner-city residents in the realms of education, workers rights, healthcare, and stood to fight for women's rights and civil rights as interconnected movements. Her campaign slogan “Unbought and Unbossed” reflects the energy and the essence of her impact in both American politics and Black American activism during a time when a woman's voice was underrepresented in both. Shirley Chisholm’s legacy is extraordinary, and we highly encourage you to learn more about her by clicking the link below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyEy_RRIEhE . . . #YELLS #YELLSFamily #AfterschoolProgram #ASP #CommunityActionCafe #CAC #Mentoring #BlackHistoryMonth #BlackHistory #February #Representation #Community #Empowerment #Learning #Leading #Serving #FranklinGateway #Marietta #GA"

The White House even went so far as to say ""The inequities that Black mothers face are not isolated incidents but, rather, the byproduct of systemic racism in our society that has festered for far too long. To root it out, and improve health outcomes, we must address a broad range of areas where unequal access persists along racial lines — including access to health care, adequate nutrition and housing, toxin-free environments, high-paying job sectors that provide paid leave, and workplaces free from harassment and discrimination."", in an official press release."

A larger share of voters age 65 and over voted nontraditionally (77.7%) than those in younger age groups (69.7% or less). Those with a bachelor's degree or higher also voted early or by mail at a higher rate (74.5%) than those with lower educational attainment (63.2% for high school graduates).

This is an organization that works with the Kansas Alliance for Health, Estimates of monthly poverty rates during the pandemic highlight the benefit of annual Child Tax Credit (CTC) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) payments for children and working-age adults. They also illustrate how stimulus and expanded unemployment payments reduced financial hardships, particularly for children. But these payments were sporadic, such that the child poverty rate increased to above pre-pandemic levels throughout the latter half of 2020. The 2021 American Rescue Plan includes new monthly CTC payments starting in July 2021. CTC payments reduced child poverty to 11.9% in July and 11.5% in August. CTC payments will continue through December 2021. Social Security, by far the most prominent American safety net program, was enacted after the Great Depression to stabilize the financial well-being of the elderly. But the program excluded initially domestic and agricultural workers — a large share of whom were Black. Unemployment insurance and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (commonly called ""welfare"") programs were enacted in 1935. Programs designed to provide assistance to non-elderly low-income Americans, including Head Start, food assistance programs, and the EITC, were instituted in the 1960s and 70s. Welfare was reformed in 1996 to include work requirements, but CTC provided some support to families with children starting in 1998 regardless of work status. For 20 years, the CTC received strong bipartisan support and was increased several times, most recently in 2018. Studies of CTC's impact found that this financial support for children helped increase student test scores, reduce teen birth rates, and yield higher earnings in adulthood. In 2019, $1 trillion was spent on Social Security. In contrast, $360 billion was spent on safety net programs such as the EITC, CTC, unemployment insurance, food assistance, and child care. Still, these later programs reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 14% by 2017 (once all such transfers are included). Other things you might want to read.

Corpses were piled five deep, and many of the bodies were wounded multiple times. This crime came 8 years after the United States declared war against Spain in April 1898, launching the Spanish-American war. In August 1898, Spain, facing defeat, allowed U.S. forces to take control of Manila. By the end of 1898, Spain was forced to cede its colonies of Cuba, Guam and Puerto Rico to the U.S., and for $20 million, the Philippines. In early 1899, when it became clear the U.S. had no intention of allowing the Philippines to be independent, Emilio Aguinaldo, who led the Filipino people’s revolt against the Spanish colonialists, launched a new war of independence against the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. war on and occupation of the Philippines lasted from 1899 to 1902. More than 126,000 U.S. troops were sent to crush the Filipino people’s mass uprising, and they waged war on wide swaths of the Philippine population as a whole. According to one account: “it became commonplace for entire villages to be burned and whole populations to be imprisoned in concentration camps. No mercy was accorded to Filipino prisoners, a large number of whom were shot.” The U.S. occupiers tortured Filipino rebels, suppressed organizations of workers and peasants, burned crops and food supplies, and carried out mass executions, often by clubbing or bayoneting people to death. Filipinos who refused to pledge allegiance to the U.S. flag were sometimes imprisoned. There was a conscious U.S. policy of massacres coming from the top. In 1901, American troops retaliated against the defeat of a U.S. garrison on the island of Samar by killing all males over 10 years old, and butchering many women and children as well. An American marine major reported: “General [Jacob] Smith instructed me to kill and burn, and that the more I killed and burned the better pleased he would be; that it was no time to take prisoners, and that I was to make Samar Island a howling wilderness.” When the major asked what the age limit should be for the killing, the general said, “Everything over ten.” It is estimated that between 250,000 and one million Filipinos were killed in this U.S. war of conquest—in combat and through disease and famine. The savagery of the U.S. war was captured in pictures of American soldiers standing on mounds of the skulls and bones of Filipinos they had massacred, piled in mass graves. Torture carried out by the U.S. military included waterboarding. U.S. Lieutenant Grover Flint described how he waterboarded 160 people, and only 26 survived: “A man is thrown down on his back and three or four men sit or stand on his arms and legs and hold him down; and either a gun barrel or a rifle barrel or a carbine barrel or a stick ... is simply thrust into his jaws and his jaws are thrust back.... In the case of very old men I have seen their teeth fall out.... He is simply held down and then water is poured onto his face down his throat and nose from a jar; and that is kept up until the man gives some sign or becomes unconscious. And, when he becomes unconscious, he is simply rolled aside and he is allowed to come to.... A man suffers tremendously, there is no doubt about it. His sufferings must be that of a man who is drowning, but cannot drown....” The author Mark Twain summed up that in the Philippines, the U.S. had “buried them; destroyed their fields, burned their villages, and turned their widows and orphans out of doors; furnished heartbreak by exile to some dozens of disagreeable patriots; subjugated the remaining tens of millions....” The U.S. military carried out the conquest and “pacification” of the Filipino people under the same racist thinking and justification as their genocidal wars against Native Americans, with U.S. forces referring to the Filipinos as “niggers,” “barbarians,” and “savages.” The Spanish-American War and the U.S. conquest of the Philippines marked the bloody rise of U.S. imperialism. The U.S. rushed to take control of Spain’s colonies to prevent other rivals from grabbing them. Seizing the Philippines was a critical step in forging the American empire, because it’s a gateway to and outpost in Asia, a country with people to exploit and resources to plunder.
