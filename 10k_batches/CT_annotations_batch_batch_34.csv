A rather broad term, Asian/Pacific encompasses all of the Asian continent and the Pacific islands of Melanesia (New Guinea, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji and the Solomon Islands), Micronesia (Marianas, Guam, Wake Island, Palau, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Nauru and the Federated States of Micronesia) and Polynesia (New Zealand, Hawaiian Islands, Rotuma, Midway Islands, Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Easter Island). The month of May was chosen to commemorate the immigration of the first Japanese to the United States on May 7, 1843, and to mark the anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869. The majority of the workers who laid the tracks were Chinese immigrants. Looking for ways to celebrate Asian / Pacific American Heritage month? Check out San Francisco's Asian Art Museum calendar of events to get involved in the celebration!

Book Club will meet on May 12th to discuss Minor Feelings by Cathy Park Hong. Hong dissects her experiences as an Asian American to create an intricate meditation on racial awareness in the U.S. Through a combination of cultural criticism and personal stories, Hong, a poet, lays bare the shame and confusion she felt in her youth as the daughter of Korean immigrants, and the way those feelings morphed as she grew older. From analyzing Richard Pryor’s stand-up to interrogating her relationship with the English language, Hong underscores essential themes of identity and otherness. 👉Books are available for checkout at the Advanced Learning Library.

I have pointed out where America 1st & members of the populist left such as Bernie, fight for American jobs, limited immigration & restrained foreign policy. These issues are now exposed by many republicans, but prior to Trump these were not standard republican positions. The GOP establishment wants to go back to shipping jobs overseas, mass immigration & endless wars. This is why they hated Trump and are coming after me. Flipping blue dog Dems & the working class was how Trump won in 2016. The establishment is at war with the populist right, we are an assault on the corporate interests.

Title 42 allows the U.S. to rapidly expel migrants coming into the country, without reviewing asylum needs or following mandated deportation procedures (which can often take months to go into effect). This is all done under the guise of “public health safety” at the same time that the U.S. is rolling back on other very important safety practices. Yet, Title 42 had no effect on the many white Ukrainian refugees that sought asylum during COVID - this is because this policy has nothing to do with public health, it is an excuse to target brown immigrants specifically at the Mexican border. 2 court rulings were revealed March 4th 2022, both taking place on the same day and directly opposing each other. While the D.C. court of appeals ruled to block the government from sending families to places where they could face persecution or danger. However, the court reminded silent regarding the broad boundaries of this ruling which leaves a scary amount of leeway for the U.S. government to continue to expel migrants seeking refuge. Furthermore, this decision will only apply to families traveling with minor children, therefore, all other asylum-seekers could still be expelled under Title 42 in the same way as before—even if they showed that they faced likely persecution. Meanwhile, the Texas court ruling which took place only a few hours after D.C. had the opposite conclusion. Judge Mark Pittman argued that the Biden administration had no right to exempt unaccompanied minors from expulsion under Title 42 because such an exemption was “arbitrary and capricious.” Biden has the choice to continue rapidly deporting immigrants, now including the minors in government custody, back into deadly situations of persecution - or - he can end it all by repealing Title 42."

Through her activism and scholarship over the last decades, her work as an educator – both at the university level and in the larger public sphere – has always emphasized the importance of building communities of struggle for economic, racial, and gender justice. In recent years, her work has been the range of social problems associated with incarceration and the generalized criminalization of those communities that are most affected by poverty and racial discrimination, drawing on her own experiences in the early seventies as a person who spent eighteen months in jail and on trial, after being placed on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted List.” Today, she continues to be an activist and lecturer as Professor Emeritus of History of Consciousness and Feminist Studies at the University of California at Santa Cruz.

As a self-described “Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,” Lorde dedicated her life to grappling with the critical and often intersecting injustices of racism, classism, sexism, and homophobia. She was a vigilant champion for Black queer women whose critiques of the racism within feminist movements offered a voice to Black women who often felt unseen and left behind. Her radical perspectives helped forge the way for the contemporary radical Black feminists of today and created pathways for unity across the social divides she navigated in her own life."

As she became increasingly aware of the conjunction of racism and sexism in her own life, and in the lives of other Black women, Murray used the expression #JaneCrow — alluding to “Jim Crow,” the discriminatory system of state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the southern United States — to articulate how racial and gender-based oppressions combined to circumscribe Black women’s freedom, a theory that would later become known as #intersectionality.

Enjoy a live conversation discussing #1 bestseller The Splendid and The Vile from the comfort of your living room on Wednesday, March 9th from 7 to 8pm. Signed books will be included with ticket purchase. In The Splendid and the Vile, Erik Larson shows, in cinematic detail, how Churchill taught the British people “the art of being fearless.” It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it’s also an intimate domestic drama, set against the backdrop of Churchill’s prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course, 10 Downing Street in London. Drawing on diaries, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports—some released only recently—Larson provides a new lens on London’s darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his family: his wife, Clementine; their youngest daughter, Mary, who chafes against her parents’ wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; Pamela’s illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the advisers in Churchill’s “Secret Circle,” to whom he turns in the hardest moments.
