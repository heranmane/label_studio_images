She was best known for her powerful opening statement at the House Judiciary Committee hearings during the impeachment process against Richard Nixon, and as the first Black woman to deliver a keynote address at the 1976 Democratic National Convention. Barbara was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bill Clinton in 1994 for her work as a political trailblazer. While Barbara never explicitly acknowledged her sexual orientation in public, she was open about her life partner of nearly 30 years, Nancy Earl.

But while the test often took place at historically Black universities, nightclubs, and professional networks, this practice actually has its origins in American slavery. In those days, enslaved Black people who were light-skinned — and often the descendants of their own enslavers — were frequently given better treatment on plantations. This usually meant working inside the house instead of out in the fields, gaining an education, and sometimes even being freed. By contrast, newly arrived enslaved people from Africa typically had darker skin tones and were sent to do the most demanding physical labor. By the time slavery ended and Jim Crow began, many light-skinned descendants of enslaved people had started to form their own clubs based on a presumed shared European ancestry. And tragically, some of these societies chose to shut out darker-skinned Black people by literally using a paper bag to determine whether they were ""light"" enough to gain entrance.

With believable characters and rich descriptions, author Ginny Dye takes the reader into a world when life was not easy and and where personal choices seem more profound . Falling in love with the main character, Carrie, is easy because the author does a wonderful job of taking the reader inside of her maturing thoughts and internal conflicts. I can hardly wait to read the next novel in the series ! REVIEW: Ginny Dye takes very ordinary people, places them in the extraordinary time of the pre-Civil War era, and creates a world that is simultaneously understandable and monumental. This is a great book and a fun read. I'm looking forward to the future adventures in the series, because I have really begun caring about these characters! The book is profound without being preachy and offers a fresh look at a time and place that has been scrutinized for 150 years. REVIEW:I loved every bit of this book. It kept me up far too late each night reading just to see what was going to happen next. It was the first thing I picked up each morning. I just could not put it down until I had finished it. I liked the characters and felt like I was right there with them. Thank you Ms. Dye for showing that the Civil War was fought for more reasons than the right to own slaves.

That person is my twin sister...and here's why. It was time for my sister's departure after a long reunion visit from Naples, Fla. As it happened the only flights she could take back were not only a weird diversion from what could ever be called a direct connection, it included 2 stopovers, each of which gave her enough 'between time' to take up residence at each location. REVIEW:I found this series quite by accident. I have found it so profoundly fascinating. Many of the reviews I have read have said things about the historical context of the books -- that some of the things listed as historical were so far fetched, they could not be true. It is very interesting to me that I remember learning about the Civil War in school and the big thing I cam away with is that President Lincoln freed the slaves and that it was the bloodiest war in our history.

The historical aspect of it is meaningful to me because of the Civil War since I live near Gettysburg and have been to some of the places mentioned in the books, such as Hampton and Sharpsburg. As the author was talking about where the war took place in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, I could picture what the places look like now. I recommend this series to people who love historical fiction. I can't wait until the next book is released. REVIEW: The author provides enough detail for each character that you personally know them. The story is about the old south which is my cup of tea I love to read about the old Plantation Homes. I have visited many of the homes in Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas and the author is right on. The story line is great, Love the book.

You can tell she has done a lot of research. I look forward to reading the books to follow. Thanks for such a great series! REVIEW: To sum it up, I'm spellbound by both. I've lost countless hours of sleep. Can't put the books down. Love the time period, characterizations, and the plot. REVIEW: If you liked Gone with the Wind you will love this. The story is much more personal about the time and events of the Civil War, it is not so much about the social lives as the events. It is, however, not a dry historical novel.

But their flight ends in capture by the Nazis, with one member of the family taken, while the rest of the family is sent back to their village of Braquis, France, to serve the enemy who has commandeered their home. For the next four years, the Nagets live in the crosshairs of the enemy living under their roof and of the neighbors who question the family's loyalties. Every day becomes a test of faith for Michelle-in God, in family, in the hope that the Allies will come, and in the letters from a young French rebel named Légère who promises Michelle that she will be free again. But when the Nazis' torment increases, and the razor-thin line between life and death narrows for the Nagets, the family’s motto, “We do what must be done,” and Michelle’s faith in God, give her the courage to face her enemy and do whatever she must to protect the family she loves.

Ilhan Omar as the House passes Rep. Omar’s bill to address Islamophobia around the globe. Despite what the headline says (which makes it seem as if Rep. Ilhan Omar had done something wrong), Rep. Omar was the target of anti-Muslim rhetoric from Republican congressman Scott Perry, who accused her of having ties with ""terrorist organizations."" Perry repeated a number of claims that have been promoted by anti-Muslim organizations, such as accusing CAIR, the U.S.'s laregest Muslim civil rights advocacy group, of being a terrorist organization. Ultimately Rep. Perry was barred from speaking again Tuesday night, and the bill to combat anti-Muslim bigotry passed late Tuesday night along party lines, 219 to 212.

Then, tired of having to submit her work to government censors, Mai Khoi nominated herself to run in Vietnam’s National Assembly elections on a pro-democracy platform. Her turn to political activism led to repeat detention, punishment and threats to her safety – along with prizes for her advocacy. Now living in exile in the United States and unable to go back to her homeland, the 39-year-old Mai Khoi spoke to RFA’s Vietnamese Service for International Women’s Day. “My friends and I have been fighting against AK47, or the Cyber Security Forces in Vietnam, in order to protect the freedom of expression on social media. The achievement that I am most proud of is to have been able to create enough pressure on Facebook so that it … removed many groups of public opinion workers in Vietnam who used to report political dissidents on purpose in order to get their accounts closed down and to muzzle them.” Read more at https://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/women-maikhoi-03082022075656.html"

According to another reporter, ""excluding certain candidates solely on the basis of race and gender is beyond extremely divisive; it may even be illegal.""   No other group of people has been more marginalized in American politics than black women.      President Biden echoes this in his statement that says, ""   Black women have been marginalized in American politics for centuries and the time has come to right the imbalance of a court made up entirely of white men for almost two centuries, a change Biden said Thursday is ""long overdue.""   What are your thoughts on President Biden’s statement and vow to appoint a black woman to the Supreme Court?"

In June 2021, Forrest’s remains were transported from their burial site in Memphis to the National Confederate Museum in Columbia, Tenn.; the transfer came mostly from the result of activist efforts to destroy any residual legacy of Forrest from the predominantly-Black Memphis. The next month, a bust of the general was removed from the Tennessee State Capitol which, according to The Tennessean, was the subject of controversy for nearly 45 years. Then, last month, the notoriously malformed statue of Forrest in Nashville was taken down. Erected in 1998, the statue was visible to those entering the city on I-65 and frequently targeted by vandals. As we witness these removals, we must remember that the simple removal of Confederate statues will not correct representations of the hideous past of the United States.""
