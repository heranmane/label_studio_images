Two days following the public lynchings of Mr. Duncan and Mr. Coker, a newspaper reported that “now the great state of Missouri faces the probable disgrace of letting two innocent men be hanged by a mob.” The day before the lynching, a white woman reported that she had been assaulted by two African American men. Despite having “no evidence against them,” Mr. Duncan and Mr. Coker were “arrested on suspicion” by local police. The men were taken to the county jail to await trial, even though their employer had also provided an alibi for them to confirm that they had not been involved in the alleged assault. During this era, race—rather than guilt—made African Americans vulnerable to indiscriminate suspicion and false accusation after a reported crime, even when there was no evidence tying them to the alleged offense. White people's allegations against African Americans were rarely subject to scrutiny, and the mere accusation that a Black man had been sexually inappropriate with a white woman often aroused violent reprisal before the judicial system could or would act. In the case of Mr. Duncan and Mr. Coker, one newspaper reported the lynch mob “was bent on vengeance and in no mood to discriminate between guilt and innocence.” When the mob arrived at the county jail, local law enforcement did little to stop the mob from seizing Mr. Duncan and Mr. Coker, though the officers were armed and responsible for protecting the men in their custody. When the mob dragged Mr. Duncan and Mr. Coker outside, the gathered crowd of nearly 3,000 angry white men, women, and children began shouting, “Hang them!” and “Burn them!” At the public square, the mob hanged both men from the railing of the Gottfried Tower, then set a fire underneath and watched as both corpses were reduced to ashes in the flames. Continuing their rampage, the mob returned to the jail and proceeded to lynch another African American man—Will Allen. Local police had abandoned the prisoners, and it was only when the state militia arrived that the mob was dispersed and prevented from seizing anyone else from the jail. Two days after the lynching of these three men, the woman who reported being assaulted issued a statement that she was “positive"" that [Mr. Coker and Mr. Duncan] ""were not her assailants, and that she could identify her assailants if they were brought before her.” But the lynch mob's act of racial terror had made its mark, terrorizing the entire Black community. Many local Black residents had fled their jobs and homes to escape the mob attack. Following the lynchings and mob violence, a grand jury was called to indict anyone who had participated in the mob. By April 19, four white men had been arrested and 25 warrants were issued. Only one white man was tried, however, and no one was ever convicted. Horace Duncan, Fred Coker, and Will Allen were three of at least 60 African American victims of racial terror lynching in Missouri between 1877 and 1950.] https://calendar.eji.org/racial-injustice/apr/14"

'The numbers add urgency to the growing push from advocates to prevent deadly stops and remove officers from traffic enforcement following the police killing of Patrick Lyoya, a Black #Michigan man, earlier this month.' 'Encounters with police during traffic stops, including minor infractions, disproportionately harm people of color, according to data collected by Mapping Police Violence, a non-profit research group, which argues that armed police should not be involved in many of these cases.' 'About 10% of the roughly 1,100 people killed by police each year involve traffic violations, the group found.' '""We often see the most extreme examples on the news, but this is something that happens so frequently,"" said Samuel Sinyangwe, a data scientist and policy analyst who founded Mapping Police Violence.' 'There were 97 deadly traffic stops in 2017; 114 in 2018; 117 in 2019; 119 in 2020; 117 in 2021; and 25 so far in 2022 as of April, according to the data.' 'There has been renewed scrutiny of traffic stops since the 4 April killing of Lyoya, an unarmed 26-year-old in #GrandRapids, Michigan. He was shot in the back of the head after a struggle with an officer who pulled him over for having a mismatched license plate. Lyoya’s death is the most recent that has captured headlines and calls for change.' 'Daunte Wright, 20, was killed after being pulled over for an expired registration tag and a hanging air freshener; Sandra Bland, 28, was stopped for failing to signal; and 32-year-old Philando Castile died following a traffic stop after an officer claimed he looked like a suspect in a recent robbery, citing his “wide-set nose.""' 'Mapping Police Violence tracks deaths reported by government and media, and categorizes a killing as a traffic case if the encounter began with a routine stop for a traffic violation. It does not classify deaths as traffic violations if the individual was pulled over for other reasons. Black drivers make up 28% of those killed in traffic stops, while accounting for only 13% of the population. Research has consistently found that Black and brown drives are more likely to be stopped, searched and subjected to force.'

Dignified Life: A Photovoice project of trans migrants in El Paso, Tx and Ciudad Juárez, México. Dignified Life Photovoice over 70 photos and stories created by transgender migrant women in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, México. In May 2021, 24 transmigrant women were recruited by the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juárez (UACJ, for its Spanish acronym) to be part of a study using the Photovoice methodology. Photovoice is a Participatory Action Research approach that allows participants to share their perspectives through narrative and photography. This exhibit documents their aspirations, challenges, and opportunities on topics such as resilience, mental health, migration, COVID-19 pandemic, discrimination, solidarity, and self-identifying as trans. Our goal is to amplify their voices challenging the normative culture by highlighting their aspirations for a dignified life of opportunities free of violence. Additionally, participants created a call to action to raise awareness of policy change. This study was sponsored by the Research Program on Migration and Health (PIMSA, for its Spanish acronym). #DignifiedLife #transgendercommunity #photovoice #utep #CentennialMuseum #elp"

A lawsuit, seeking $1 million in damages, was recently filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court against Red Robin International, Inc. and Jason Fosberg, who was the manager overseeing employees at the time of the alleged incident. Fosberg is not accused of contaminating the salad. The customer’s name is not listed in the lawsuit but is identified as ""C.T."" According to court documents obtained by FOX Television Stations, C.T., a Black customer, arrived with family and friends at a Red Robin restaurant in Clackamas, Oregon, in March 2021. C.T. complained that his group ""was not treated the same way as the restaurant’s other patrons who were present at the time."" The lawsuit also alleged Fosberg referred to the customer’s group of family and friends as ""a big gang."" C.T. then complained about the alleged manager’s comments to the restaurant. The lawsuit stated C.T. then ordered a salad and while eating it, he noticed it contained semen. According to attorney Jason Kafoury, C.T. immediately felt ""nauseated, queasy and disgusted"" before being hospitalized for nausea and a panic attack. The lawsuit also stated the substance was sent to a laboratory and was found to be semen. Police also investigated but were unable to obtain DNA samples from employees because the restaurant could not identify who was working during those hours because of a data hack to the system, according to court documents. The customer is suing Red Robin for sexual battery, negligence and discrimination."

In fact, merging existing Jewish tradition with that of other cultures is a longstanding Jewish practice found at nearly every turn in Jewish history—perhaps even a practice that has ensured the persistence of the Jewish people. When Jews of Color are able to unquestioningly express themselves and their Judaism in ways that represent the wholeness of multifaceted identity, the entire Jewish people will be enriched. . . . . . . . . . #jewsofcolor #joc #beyondthecount #doubleconsciousness #eyesofothers #webdubois #dubois #racism #jewish #jewishcommunity #bipoc #jewishtradition #jewishculture #culture #history #antiracism #judaism #identity #multifacetedidentity #intersectionality #peoplehood #americanracism #diversity #jewishexpressions #multicultural #wholeness #unquestioned"

Any rebuttal you come up with opposing this statement can easily be rerouted BACK to racism and it's residual effects. The reason such monster hasn't been quelled & stamped out is due to the participants who play both sides. How are they playing both sides?? By befriending those targeted and convincing them that it isn't an issue anymore that should be fought for. Why do this? So their positions won't be jeopardized with either the Oppressor nor the Oppressed. #MoralStraddlers Of course you'll say ""All are not bad"". This is Truth. BUT THE MAJORITY KEEP SILENT TO NOT BITE THE HAND WHICH THEY BENEFIT FROM. Racism is really only talked about in circles and households which are directly effected by it. Those who benefit from the systemic practices of Racism do not teach their kids how to stop it, how it was created nor what it looks like. They just teach them to ""treat everyone equally"". If the rules of equality were created by those who've pillaged the world's resources, how can you ever be Equal without Equity in those resources?? What does equal really mean? Every Fortune 500 company out there was built on the backs of bondage, we can't own them, tax them and barely can work for them; so where does the playing field ""equal out"" at???

Unfortunately, our elected officials aren't listening. We're calling on Governor John Bel Edwards to VETO any and all unjust maps presented to him this redistricting session, especially racist Congressional maps. Louisiana is well overdue for two majority-minority Congressional districts so BIPOC can elect their candidate of choice and effectively participate in decision-making that affects their own communities.
