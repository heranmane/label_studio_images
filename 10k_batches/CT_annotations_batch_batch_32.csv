Today the state of California has ended its mask mandate but it doesn't mean we should put our masks away! Don't let your guard down with COVID still around! ""Along with vaccines, masks have helped us reduce COVID-19 infections throughout the state—but we’re not finished. Let’s stay focused on what we know: Masks work. Vaccines work. Clearly, prevention is more effective than treatment. When we are proactive in prevention, we save more lives and resources. Prevention also protects our children, grandparents, and all those who are more likely to become severely ill, end up in the hospital, or die from COVID-19. We cannot stop now when we are so close to the finish line; we must continue to take precautions to keep ourselves and others safe and healthy. That is the only way we can get to #OneHealthyFresno.""

But I have seen many men, from whom one is given the Qur'an before Imaan, and he reads it from the opening of the Book to its closing and he does not know what it orders and what it forbids and what should be his stance towards it. He is like someone who is just throwing out dates."" Subhana’Allah! This is such a powerful narration and perfectly encapsulates what the Prophet (pbuh) set out to do during the initial stages of Islam. We need to pause and rethink what approach we are undertaking when raising our children? How are we teaching our children and what are we focussing first few years of teaching the deen to them?

Their creativity compensated the condition they were living in. It made the women of high society so jealous that in order to recreate the feeling of privilege they were entitled to, they asked their husbands to punish Black women. But it didn’t stop Black women from still thriving. They managed to find another creative way to shine through that injustice. That’s something Black people are used to.

It served as the government’s guide in planning and budgeting for GAD programs and projects, and activities. In 2004, Republic Act no. 9262, also known as the Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children (VAWC), was enacted. This Act penalizes the commission of violence against women and their children (VAWC) in the context of domestic violence or violence in intimate relationships. In 2006, the Gender-Responsive Economic Actions for the Transformation of Women (GREAT Women) Project was implemented. It is a governance and capacity development project that aimed to promote and support a gender-responsive enabling environment for women’s economic empowerment, specifically those in the micro enterprise. In 2008, the Philippine government has received commendation from the Association of South East Asian Nations’ member-states for the country’s success in closing the gender gap by promoting human development opportunities. The Philippines has successfully maintained its 6th rank in the Global Gender Index. On 14 August 2009, Republic Act No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women was signed. It is a comprehensive women’s rights law that seeks to eliminate discrimination against women by recognizing, protecting, fulfilling and promoting the rights of Filipino women, especially those in the marginalized sectors. It also expanded the functions of then NCRFW subsequently changing its name to the Philippine Commission on Women. #WomenMakeChange #NWMC2022 #AgendaNgKababaihan Photos c/o https://pcw.gov.ph/gloria-macapagal-arroyo/"

In October 2015, Ju’Zema Goldring was crossing the street in midtown Atlanta with friends, after having recently moved to Georgia from Maryland. She was stopped for jaywalking by Atlanta police officers Vladimir Henry and Juan Restrepo, who then took her into custody on grounds that she could be trafficking cocaine. The officers focused on the fact that Goldring had been carrying a stress ball, saying it could be hiding drugs. She told the officers to cut open the ball and test its contents, one of her attorneys, Miguel Dominguez, said in a phone interview. Henry complied, conducting multiple tests. All of them turned out negative. At one point, as “a visibly frustrated” Henry was testing the stress ball’s contents, Goldring heard another Atlanta police officer who was passing by Henry’s desk telling him to “give it up buddy, it’s not a drug,” according to Dominguez. But he didn’t. Henry filed an arrest warrant against Goldring, saying she had been carrying illegal substances. Goldring ended up in jail and wouldn’t be released until almost six months later, in March 2016, after prosecutors realized the drug tests in fact had been negative. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation completed its own tests on the sand inside Goldring’s stress ball, more than a month after her arrest, and they were negative, as well. Judge William M. Ray II, who oversaw the lawsuit… (more @washingtonpost)"

It is still standing almost a year later and looks like it will remain intact until at least September 2023, when Yair Lapid is scheduled to take over as Prime Minister. Nonetheless, key issues remain that threaten the stability of the coalition. For example, recent settler violence in the West Bank, debates over the citizenship law, and balancing Israeli foreign vs. domestic policy have all been contentious topics that have sparked inter and intra-party friction in the coalition. Furthermore, questions revolving around Netenyahu’s future in the government threaten the sustainability of the alliance, as he is the paradoxical glue holding it together. With just a one-seat majority in parliament, this coalition government cannot afford to lose one of its parties, or it will fall. Thus, these issues must be handled with extreme caution, or Israelis may head to their 5th election in two years. Join us to discuss with David Makovsky-- the Ziegler distinguished fellow and director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Project on the Middle East Peace Process. Dr. Makovsky has extensive experience covering events in Israel as a journalist, researcher, and advisor on peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinian and will provide crucial insight into the state of the Israeli coalition today."
