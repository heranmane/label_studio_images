Directions: 1. Place steaks on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill steaks, covered, 11 to 14 minutes (over medium heat on a preheated gas grill, covered, 11 to 15 minutes) for medium-rare (145°F) to medium (160°F) doneness, turning occasionally. A table-top griddle or frying pan can be used if you don’t have a grill. 2. Meanwhile, to prepare the dressing, whisk together soy sauce and sesame oil in a small bowl; set aside. 3. Divide rice evenly among four bowls. Top rice with vegetables and kimchi. 4. Carve steaks into thin pieces and divide evenly among bowls. Drizzle with dressing.

It should be a day to celebrate victory over segregation, but what do I see when I get on a local news site but an article about a local school board hosting separate meetings for white people and black people. The Issaquah School Board says they're doing this to protect black folks who don't feel comfortable around white folks, but it's funny, because that's the exact same reasoning used to justify ""separate but equal"" facilities in the Jim Crow South. Back in those days, it was the white folks who supposedly didn't feel comfortable drinking at the same fountains, using the same bathrooms, and eating at the same lunch counters with colored folks. But other than that, everything's the same. At least in Issaquah. Segregation has been outlawed all over the country, but apparently the Issaquah School Board hasn't gotten the message yet. There are a couple ways to deal with segregation. One is lawsuits and one is civil disobedience. In other words, sit-ins, like they did in Nashville. Of the two methods, I like sit-ins better. Any time a public official tells you you can't go to a meeting because you're the wrong color, you should go to that meeting anyway. And when you do, bring some of your friends along. Then report back to us on what happens. –David"

Save the Redwoods League planned to announce Tuesday that it is transferring more than 500 acres (202 hectares) on the Lost Coast to the InterTribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council. The group of 10 tribes that have inhabited the area for thousands of years will be responsible for protecting the land dubbed Tc’ih-Léh-Dûñ, or “Fish Run Place,” in the Sinkyone language. Priscilla Hunter, chairwoman of the Sinkyone Council, said it’s fitting they will be caretakers of the land where her people were removed or forced to flee before the forest was largely stripped for timber. “It’s a real blessing,” said Hunter, of the Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians. “It’s like a healing for our ancestors. I know our ancestors are happy. This was given to us to protect.” The transfer marks a step in the growing Land Back movement to return Indigenous homelands to the descendants of those who lived there for millennia before European settlers arrived. The league first worked with the Sinkyone council when it transferred a 164-acre (66-hectare) plot nearby to the group in 2012. The league recently paid $37 million for a scenic 5-mile (8-kilometer) stretch of the rugged and forbidding Lost Coast from a lumber company to protect it from logging and eventually open it up to the public. Opening access to the public is not a priority on the property being transferred to the tribal group because it is so remote, said Sam Hodder, president and CEO of the league. But it serves an important puzzle piece wedged between other protected areas. Steep hills rise and fall to a tributary of the Eel River that has steelhead trout and Coho salmon. The property was last logged about 30 years ago and still has a large number of old-growth redwoods, as well as second-growth trees. “This is a property where you can almost tangibly feel that it is healing, that it is recovering,” Hodder said. “You walk through the forest and, even as you see the kind of ghostly stumps of ancient trees that were harvested, you could also in the foggy landscape see the monsters that were left behind as well as the young redwoods that are sprouting from those stumps.” The league purchased the land two years ago for $3.5 million funded by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to provide habitat for endangered northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet to mitigate other environmental damage by the utility. PG&E was set to emerge Tuesday from five years of criminal probation for a 2010 explosion triggered by its natural gas lines that blew up a San Bruno neighborhood and killed eight people. It's been blamed since 2017 for sparking more than 30 wildfires that wiped out more than 23,000 homes and businesses and killed more than 100 people. In an effort to reduce its liability and the chance of vegetation contacting power lines and sparking fires, PG&E has been criticized for destroying many large and old trees. “Thanks to Save the Redwoods League for seizing on any opportunity to protect lands on the Lost Coast that are vital to its conservation,” said Michael Evenson, vice president of the Lost Coast League, which advocates for protecting water and wildlife in the area. “But PG&E getting a green merit badge after all the destruction they’re doing ... is not palatable.” Hawk Rosales, former executive director of the council, said the new property adds a significant holding to the 4,000 acres (1,618.7 hectares) the group protects for cultural and ecological purposes. More importantly, it recognizes the tribal group’s importance in caring for lands. “For so many decades tribal voices have been marginalized in the mainstream conservation movement,” Rosales said. “It’s only until very recently that they have been invited to participate meaningfully and to take a leadership role.” Hodder said the league was trying to remove barriers and increase the scale of land managed by tribal communities and return Indigenous knowledge and practices, such as setting small controlled fires to clear out undergrowth that lead to healthier forests. “These communities have been stewarding these lands across thousands of years,"" Hodder said. “It was the exclusion of that stewardship in many ways that’s gotten us into the mess that we’re in.”"

The number of ginsenoside types contained in Korean ginseng (38 ginsenosides) is substantially more than that of ginsenoside types contained in American ginseng (19 ginsenosides). Furthermore, Korean ginseng has been identified to contain more main non-saponin compounds, phenol compounds, acid polysaccharides and polyethylene compounds than American ginseng and Sanchi ginseng. Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C A Meyer / Araliaceae ) is one of the most heavily studied ginsengs in the world and is traditionally used as an important herbal medicine in Far East Asia. Our Korean Ginseng is standardized to 5% [17.5 mg] ginsenosides per 350 mg capsule of Panax ginseng root extract powder. * The German botanist Nees Von Esenbeck first classified Korean ginseng as Panax shinseng var. coraiensis Nees in 1833, with the term coraiensis referring to Korea as its wild habitat. The Russian botanist Carl Anton Meyer renamed the plant Panax ginseng in 1843. For many years, Korea has operated the Office of Monopoly, to safeguard and oversee the quality of ginseng that is produced in Korea. All ginseng products that are sold must bear the seal of the Office of Monopoly. It is illegal to remove ginseng seeds from Korea in an attempt to cultivate them elsewhere. Ginseng.

In a landmark unanimous vote, the resolution introduced by Supervisor Matt Haney in partnership with former SFUD students was approved last week by the board’s Budget and Finance Committee. The resolution cited numerous instances of racism against the Chinese community dating back to the 19th century, including SFUSD’s closure of Chinese schools between 1870-1885. It also apologizes for the three-day riot in 1877 that targeted the Chinese community: four people died and dozens of Chinese-owned laundries were destroyed or looted. In addition, the resolution acknowledges current ongoing racism and violence against the Chinese and AAPI communities amid the COVID-19 pandemic and pledges budget investments in support of the AAPI community. CHSA will be hosting a press conference along with Supervisor Haney, members of the API Council, and former students on Wednesday, February 2 at 9am with the formal apology. The announcement and ceremony will take place outside the CHSA museum on Joice Street. 📷: https://www.instagram.com/photobykev_/ ~~~~~ Chinese Historical Society of America Gordon Mar 馬兆明 Connie Chan 陳詩敏 London Breed 倫敦．布里德"

Less terrifying but just as haunted, María Teresa Rodríguez (MFA '97) tells a comic and semi-surreal tale with Cuban American Gothic, about a woman living alone during the early 2020 pandemic whose Cuban parents return from the dead to remind her of their immigrant journey and give her the strength to meet the moment.

While Andraya already graduated, there’s a group in her home state attempting to take away all records of her past athletic achievements. We joined a lawsuit to defend Andraya in court against those attacks last November. This pattern of discrimination and exclusion toward trans students is one we’ve seen nationwide: state legislatures have proposed, and even passed, all-out bans on our participation in sports. These laws are about nothing more than erasing and excluding us from all aspects of public life. But we’re sending a message to state politicians that if you come for one of us, you have to get through ALL of us. Let’s thank Andraya for her leadership this #WomensHistoryMonth"

In an extraordinary admission today COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said each country would be making decisions unilaterally. In other words, there is no bubble, New Zealand will just start behaving like an Australian state, only six months late. Today’s announcement incidentally aligns with the policies ACT has been espousing for months – all of them in our COVID Response Plan 2.0. For the Prime Minister to get up today and talk about ‘green zones’ at airports like she discovered something new and deserved a Nobel Prize for it is galling in the extreme. Holding up a traffic light system on a sheet of A3 paper like the one epidemiologist Professors Michael Baker and Nick Wilson mooted months ago is also outrageous. It’s been obvious that all these steps were the way forward since New South Wales introduced them in October. We know quarantine-free travel will work and it will improve the lives of countless New Zealanders and Australians. It’s how the Australian states have been working for months and there is no excuse for New Zealand being so late to join."

Books often explore complex topics such as social issues, history, and personal experience. In many cases, those that contain materials that may be troubling for some audiences or may conflict with some audience members' values get challenged or banned. However, censoring a book in this way takes away opportunities to learn about experiences that are similar to or different from our own. As a public library, we are vigilant on issues of censorship so that these voices can be available for future generations to hear from. Set in 1941, The Bluest Eye tells the story of a young African-American girl named Pecola as she deals with external and internalized racism. Pecola has always been referred to as ugly because of her Blackness, which leads to her wanting blue eyes so that she can achieve this mythical beauty seemingly reserved only for white people. You can find this book in our physical and digital collections! [Image description: A colorful graphic shows the cover of the book, which is blank with the title written in blue text. Text at the top of the graphic reads ""Banned and challenged books: The Bluest Eye."" Under that, a list reads Black girlhood, racism and equality, counter narrative, internalized racism, and Great Depression."" At the bottom is a section surrounded by police caution tape. The section reads ""Child sexual abuse, sexually explicit, contains controversial issues, violence, language, and unsuited for age group.""] #LovelandPublicLibrary #LovelandColorado #BannedBooks #Censorship #WhatLibrariesDo #TheBluestEye #ReadBannedBooks #ToniMorrison #BookBanning"
